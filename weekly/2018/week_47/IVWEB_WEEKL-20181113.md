<p><strong>Programming Paradigms for Dummies: What Every Programmer Should Know</strong><br />
https://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/VanRoyChapter.pdf<br />
This chapter gives an introduction to all the main programming paradigms, their underlying concepts, and the relationships between them. We give a broad view to help programmers choose the right concepts they need to solve the problems at hand. We give a taxonomy of almost 30 useful programming paradigms and how they are related. Most of them differ only in one or a few concepts, but this can make a world of difference in programming.</p>

<p><strong>How to Design Software Good</strong><br />
https://www.haiku-os.org/docs/HIG/index.xml<br />
Haiku is an operating system which is known for its speed and being easy for anyone to use. This is partly because good programmers try to design their apps for more than just themselves. We are going to examine how you can also make your program more appealing. The reason is easy: easier to use means more people using your program. Writing good software can be hard, but it is worth the time and effort.</p>

<p><strong>写给自己看的display: grid布局教程</strong><br />
https://www.zhangxinxu.com/wordpress/2018/11/display-grid-css-css3/<br />
在我看来，Grid布局就像是“分田种地”。故事是这样的，张老板是个程序员，省吃俭用攒了点小钱，然后老家因为城镇化建设，农村都没什么人，土地都荒废在那里，于是就承包了一块地，打算养养鱼，种种果树。承包的地方很挺大，如何划分土地就成了问题，于是张老板打算借助Grid布局来划分。另附：.</p>

<p><strong>Cross-language Performance Profile Exploration with speedscope</strong><br />
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/11/cross-language-performance-profile-exploration-with-speedscope/<br />
The goal of speedscope is to provide a 60fps way of interactively exploring large performance profiles from a variety of profilers for a variety of programming languages. It runs totally in-browser, and does not send any profiling data to any servers. Because it runs totally in-browser, it should work in Firefox and Chrome on Mac, Windows, and Linux. It can be downloaded to run offline, either from npm, or just as a totally standalone zip file.</p>

<p><strong>Writing Quality Vulnerability Reports</strong><br />
https://blog.npmjs.org/post/179430064885/writing-quality-vulnerability-reports<br />
npm offers a way for security researchers, package users, package maintainers, and community members to report security vulnerabilities via the “Report a Vulnerability” button on npm Package pages. This provides the community a way to participate in coordinated disclosure with the package maintainer instead of opening a public issue, which could put users at risk.</p>

<p><strong>Trace Context - W3C First Public Working Draft</strong><br />
https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/7369<br />
Distributed tracing is a set of tools and practices to monitor the health and reliability of a distributed application. A distributed application is an application that consists of multiple components that are deployed and operated separately. It is also known as micro-service. The main concept behind distributed tracing is event correlation. Event correlation is a way to correlate events from one component to the events from another. It allows to find the cause-and-effect relationship between these events. For instance – find which user action in a browser caused a failure in the business logic layer.</p>

<p><strong>How Data Visualization Became Completely Meaningless</strong><br />
https://medium.com/s/story/stone-soup-anyone-7004e8aed92<br />
As with any popular idea, “data as art” has produced mixed results. But there is one particular instance of this I want to focus on, and that is the use of data as a fake ingredient. What do I mean by “fake”? Often, data is mentioned in an artwork’s marketing materials but does nothing noticeable or meaningful to the work itself.</p>

<p><strong>Why Do All Websites Look the Same?</strong><br />
https://medium.com/s/story/on-the-visual-weariness-of-the-web-8af1c969ce73<br />
The internet suffers from a lack of imagination, so I asked my students to redesign it.oday’s internet is bland. Everything looks the same: generic fonts, no layouts to speak of, interchangeable pages, and an absence of expressive visual language. Even micro-typography is a mess. Web design today seems to be driven by technical and ideological constraints rather than creativity and ideas. Every page consists of containers in containers in containers; sometimes text, sometimes images. Nothing is truly designed, it’s simply assumed. 另附：.</p>

<p>(This is a sponsored article.) WordPress has changed the way we make websites and millions of people use it to create websites today. But this tool has a few significant limitations &mdash; it requires time and coding skills to create a website.</p>

<p>Even when you have aquired coding skills, jumping into code each time when you need to solve a problem (add a new UI element or change styling options for existing one) can be tedious. All too often we hear: &ldquo;We need to work harder to achieve our goals.&rdquo; While working hard is definitely important we also need to work smarter.</p>

<p>Today, I&rsquo;d like to review a tool that will allow us to work smarter. Imagine WordPress without design and technical limits; the tool that reduces the need to hand-code the parts of your website and frees you up to work on more interesting and valuable parts of the design.</p>

<p>In this article, I’ll review the Visual Composer Website Builder and create a real-world example &mdash; a landing page for a digital product &mdash; just by using this tool.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-visual-composer-website-builder">What Is Visual Composer Website Builder?</h3>

<p> is a simple and powerful drag-and-drop website builder that promises to change the way we work with WordPress. It introduced a more intuitive way of building a page &mdash; all actions involving changing visual hierarchy and content management are done visually. The tool reduces the need to hand-code the theme parts of a website and frees you up to work on valuable parts of the design such as content.</p>

<figure>)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Content is the most important property of your website. It’s the primary reason why people visit your site &mdash; for content. It’s worth putting a lot of efforts in creating good content and use tools that help you to deliver the content in the best way to visitors with the least amount of effort.</p>

<h4 id="visual-composer-and-wpbakery">Visual Composer And WPBakery</h4>

<p>Visual Composer Website Builder is a builder from the creators of WPBakery Page Builder. If you had a chance to use the WPBakery Page builder before you might wonder what the difference between the two plugins is. Let’s be clear about these two products:</p>

<p>There are a few significant differences between the two:.</p>

<ul>
<li>The key difference between WPBakery Page builder and Visual Composer is that WPBakery is only for the content part, while with Visual Composer Website Builder you can create a complete website (including Headers and Footers).</li>
<li>Visual Composer is not shortcode based, which helps generate clean code. Also, disabling the plugin won’t leave you with &ldquo;shortcode hell&rdquo; (a situation when shortcodes can&rsquo;t be rendered without an activated plugin).</li>
</ul>

<p>You can check the .</p>

<p>Now, Visual Composer Website Builder is not an ‘advanced’ version of WPBakery. It is an entirely new product that was created to satisfy the growing needs of web professionals. Visual Composer is not just a plugin; it’s a powerful platform that can be extended as user needs continue evolving.</p>

<h3 id="a-quick-list-of-visual-composer-s-features">A Quick List Of Visual Composer’s Features</h3>

<p>While I’ll show you how Visual Composer works in action below, it’s worth to point out a few key benefits of this tool:</p>

<ul>
<li>It’s a <strong>live-preview editor</strong> with drag-and-drop features, and hundreds of ready-to-use content elements that bring a lot of design freedom. You can make changes instantly and see end-results before publishing.</li>
<li>Two ways of page editing &mdash; using frontend editor and <strong>tree view</strong>. <em>Tree view allows navigating through the elements available on a page</em> and makes a design process much easier.</li>
<li>Ready-to-use WordPress templates for all types of pages &mdash; from landing pages and portfolios to business websites with dedicated product pages, because editing an existing template is a lot easier than starting from scratch with a blank page.</li>
<li>Visual Composer works with any theme (i.e. it’s possible to integrate Visual Composer Website builder into your <em>existing</em> themes)</li>
<li>Responsive design out-of-the-box. All the elements and templates are responsive and mobile-ready. You can adjust responsiveness for each independent column.</li>
<li>Header, footer, and sidebar editor. Usually the header, footer and sidebar are defined by the theme you’re using. When web professionals need to change them, they usually move to code. But with Visual Composer, you can change the layout quickly and easily using only the visual editor. This feature is available in the Premium version of the product.</li>
<li>An impressive collection of add-ons (it’s possible to get add-ons from the Hub or get them from third-party developers)</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also three features that make Visual Composer stand out from the crowd. Here they are:</p>

<h4 id="1-visual-composer-hub">1. Visual Composer Hub</h4>

<p>Visual Composer Hub is a cloud which stores all the elements available to the users. It’s basically like a <strong>design system</strong> that keeps itself updated and where you can get new elements, templates, elements, blocks (soon).</p>

<p>The great thing about Visual Composer Hub is that you don&rsquo;t need to update the plugin to get new elements — you can download the elements whenever you need them. As a result, your WP setup isn&rsquo;t bloated with a myriad of unused elements.</p>

<h4 id="2-new-technical-stack">2. New Technical Stack</h4>

<p>Visual Composer Website builder is built on a new technology stack &mdash; it&rsquo;s powered by ReactJS and doesn&rsquo;t use any of the WordPress shortcodes. This helps to achieve better performance &mdash; the team behind Visual Composer conducted a series of internal tests and showed that pages created with Visual Composer load 1-1.5s faster than the same layouts re-created with WPBakery.</p>

<h4 id="3-api">3. API</h4>

<p>Visual Composer Website builder has . If you have coding skills, you can extend Visual Composer with your own custom elements which may be helpful for some custom projects.</p>

<h4 id="creating-a-layout-for-a-landing-page">Creating A Layout For A Landing Page</h4>

<p>The process of creating the page starts with building an appropriate layout. Usually building a layout for a landing page takes a lot of time and effort. Designers have to try a lot of different approaches before finding the one that works the best for the content. But Visual Composer simplifies the task for designers &mdash; it provides a list of ready-to-use layouts (available under the <em>Add Template</em> option). So, all you need to do to create a new page is to find the appropriate layout from the list of available options and see how it works for your content.</p>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Notice that Visual Composer uses different colored borders for UI units. When we select a row, we see a blue-colored border, when we select a column, we see an orange-colored border. This feature can be extremely valuable when you work on creating complex layouts.</p>

<p>The great thing about Visual Composer is that we can customize all properties of the layout &mdash; add/remove elements or change their styling options (such as margins, padding between elements). For example, we don’t need to dive into the code to alter the sizes of columns; we can simply drag and drop the borders of individual elements.</p>

<p>And we want to place it at the top of our newly created landing page. To do that, we need to go to Visual Composer -&gt; <em>Headers</em> (because the top of the page is a default place for navigation) and create a new header.</p>

<p>As soon as we click on the ‘Add Header’ button, we’ll see a screen that asks us to provide a title for the page &mdash; let’s give it a name “Top header.” It’s a technical name that will help us identify this object.</p>

<p>Next, Visual Composer will direct us to the Hub where we can add all required UI elements to our header. Since we want to have  a menu, we type ‘menu’ in the search box. The Hub provides us with two options: Basic menu and Sandwich menu. For our case, we’ll use the* Basic Menu* because we have a limited number of top level navigation options and want all of them to be visible all the time (hidden navigation such as Sandwich Menu can be ) .</p>

<h4 id="making-the-top-menu-sticky">Making The Top Menu Sticky</h4>

<p>The foundational principle of good navigation says that a navigation menu should be available for the users all of the time. But unfortunately, on many websites, the top navigation menu hides when you scroll. Such behavior forces users to scroll way back to the top in order to navigate to another page. It introduces unnecessary interaction costs. Fortunately, there’s a simple solution for this problem &mdash; we can make the top menu sticky. A sticky menu stays visible all the time no matter where the user is on a page.</p>

<p>To enable stickiness, we need to turn the Sticky toggle for our header <em>On</em> (for the whole Menu container) and add a margin 50-pixels margin to the <em>Margin top</em>.</p>

<p>Next comes a really exciting part &mdash; we need to describe our product to our visitors. To create a great first-time impression, we need to provide excellent images paired with a clear description. Text description and product picture (or pictures) should work together and engage visitors in learning more about a product.</p>

<p>We need to replace a default image with our image. Click on the image and upload a new one. We’ll use an image with a dart background, so we also need to change the background for the container. We need to select the row and modify the background color option.</p>

<p>Next, we need to add a text section to the left of the image. In the western world, users scan the page , so visitors will read text description and match it with the image. Visual Composer uses Text Block object to store the text information. Let’s replace a text that came with theme with our custom text “CalmTech A breakthrough speaker that adapts to its location.” Let’s also modify the text color to make the text more relevant to the theme (white for the title and a shade of gray for the subtitle).</p>

<h4 id="creating-a-group-of-elements">Creating A Group Of Elements</h4>

<p>We have a picture of a product and a text description, but still, one element is missing. As you probably guessed, it’s a call to action (CTA). Good designers don’t just create individual pages but a holistic . Thus, to create an enjoyable user journey, it’s important to guide users along the way. At the time when visitors read the necessary information, it’s vital to provide the next logical step for them, and a CTA is a precisely right element for this role.</p>

<p>In our case, we’ll need two CTAs &mdash; ‘Buy now’ and ‘Learn More.’ The primary call to action button &ldquo;Buy now&rdquo; should come first and it should be more eye-catching (we expect that users will click on it). Thus, we need to make it more contrasting while the “Learn more” button should be a hollow button.</p>

<p>Visual Composer makes it easier to customize the general parameters for the UI element (such as a gap) as well as individual styling options. Since we’re interested in changing individual properties, we need to click on ‘Edit’ for a particular button.</p>

<h4 id="playing-with-animation-to-convey-dynamics-and-telling-stories">Playing With Animation To Convey Dynamics And Telling Stories</h4>

<p>People visit dozens of different websites on a daily basis. In such a highly competitive market web professionals need to create genuinely memorable products. One way to achieve this goal is to focus on building better user engagement.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s possible to engage visitors to interact with a product by conveying some dynamics. If you make a site less static, there’s a better chance that visitors remember it.</p>

<p>Visual Composer allows you to choose from a few predefined CSS animations of a particular element. When we open design options for any UI element we can find the option <em>Animate</em>. When we choose the animated option, it’ll be triggered once the element will be visible in the browser window.</p>

<h4 id="final-polishing">Final Polishing</h4>

<p>Let’s see how our page looks like for our site’s visitors. It’s obvious that it has two problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>It looks a bit unfinished (we don’t have a logo of a website),</li>
<li>The elements have the wrong proportions (the text overpowers the image so the layout looks unbalanced).</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s solve the first problem. Go to the Headers section and select our Top Header. Click on ‘+’ element and select an object <em>Single Image</em>. Upload new image (the icon). Notice that we can modify the size of the image right in the Visual Composer. Let’s make the size of our icon 50px x 50px (in the <em>Size</em> section).</p>
