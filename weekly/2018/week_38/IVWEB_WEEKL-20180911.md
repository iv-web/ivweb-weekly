<p><strong>Removing jQuery from GitHub.com frontend</strong><br />
https://githubengineering.com/removing-jquery-from-github-frontend/<br />
We have recently completed a milestone where we were able to drop jQuery as a dependency of the frontend code for GitHub.com. This marks the end of a gradual, years-long transition of increasingly decoupling from jQuery until we were able to completely remove the library. In this post, we will explain a bit of history of how we started depending on jQuery in the first place, how we realized when it was no longer needed, and point out that—instead of replacing it with another library or framework—we were able to achieve everything that we needed using standard browser APIs.</p>

<p><strong>Migrating from Underscore to Lodash</strong><br />
https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2018/09/migrating-from-underscore-to-lodash/<br />
Over the past two years we’ve worked to modernize our front-end stack. We’ve successfully moved from CoffeeScript to TypeScript, from jQuery to React, and from a custom Flux implementation to Redux. Having completed these migrations we identified our utility library, Underscore, as one more candidate for migration.</p>

在公司发展初期，为了快速的进行业务拓展，大都不考虑成本投入，运营维护以及技术沉淀等问题。所有的指标导向都是业务的快速发展，尽可能的抢占市场份额，获取足够多的用户数量。在公司发展到一定阶段后，市场逐渐趋于稳定，先期快速扩展的各种问题会逐步暴露出来。从技术层面来讲，如果可以形成公司级别的统一开发框架，会在实际的生产过程中带来非常大的收益。</p>

https://blog.daftcode.pl/going-international-at-the-front-end-13983cee429d<br />
Internationalization (i18n) is as old as the Internet, but in the fast changing world we are moving from the “web pages” generated by the server-side, to “single page applications”. This is great in so many ways, but often we find ourselves rediscovering the wheel. In some cases, server-side solutions are easily transferable to the client, but sometimes it’s not that simple and there are additional things to consider.</p>

<p><strong>Who left open the cookie jar? A comprehensive evaluation of third-party cookie policies</strong><br />
https://blog.acolyer.org/2018/09/05/who-left-open-the-cookie-jar-a-comprehensive-evaluation-of-third-party-cookie-policies/<br />
This paper won a ‘Distinguished paper’ award at USENIX Security 2018, as well as the 2018 Internet Defense Prize. It’s an evaluation of the defense mechanisms built into browsers (and via extensions / add-ons) that seek to protect against user tracking and cross-site attacks. Testing across 7 browsers and 46 browser extensions, the authors find that for virtually every browser and extension combination there is a way to bypass the intended security policies. 另附：.</p>

<h1 id="#title_2" >3、如何降低软件的复杂性？</h1>
阮一峰
[http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2018/09/complexity.html](http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2018/09/complexity.html)
<p>John Ousterhout 是斯坦福大学计算机系教授，也是 Tcl 语言的创造者。</p>

        <p><img src="https://www.wangbase.com/blogimg/asset/201809/bg2018091008.jpg" alt="" title="" /></p>

<p>今年四月，他出版了一本新书《软件设计的哲学》（）。这是课程讲稿，160多页，亚马逊全部是五星好评。</p>

<p><img src="https://www.wangbase.com/blogimg/asset/201809/bg2018091009.jpg" alt="" title="" /></p>

<p>我还没读这本书，但是我看了作者在谷歌的一次演讲（），介绍了这本书的主要内容。我觉得非常值得看，大部分书教你怎么写正确的代码，这本书教你如何正确设计软件。</p>

<p><img src="https://www.wangbase.com/blogimg/asset/201809/bg2018091006.jpg" alt="" title="" /></p>

<p>下面我就根据演讲视频和网上的，做一下笔记。</p>

<h2>一、什么是复杂性</h2>

<p>Ousterhout 教授认为，<strong>软件设计的最大目标，就是降低复杂性（complexity）。</strong> 所谓复杂性，就是任何使得软件难于理解和修改的因素。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Complexity is anything that makes software hard to understand or to modify.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>复杂性的来源主要有两个：代码的含义模糊和互相依赖。</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Complexity is caused by obscurity and dependencies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>模糊指的是，代码里面的重要信息，看不出来。依赖指的是，某个模块的代码，不结合其他模块，就会无法理解。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Obscurity is when important information is not obvious.</p>

<p>Dependency is when code can't be understood in isolation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>复杂性的危害在于，它会递增。你做错了一个决定，导致后面的代码都基于前面的错误实现，整个软件变得越来越复杂。"我们先把产品做出来，后面再改进"，这根本做不到。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Complexity is incremental, the result of thousands of choices. Which makes it hard to prevent and even harder to fix.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>二、复杂性的隔离</h2>

<p>降低复杂性的基本方法，就是把复杂性隔离。<strong>"如果能把复杂性隔离在一个模块，不与其他模块互动，就达到了消除复杂性的目的。"</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Isolating complexity in places that are rarely interacted with is roughly equivalent to eliminating complexity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>改变软件设计的时候，修改的代码越少，软件的复杂性越低。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reduce the amount of code that is affected by each design decision, so design changes don't require very many code modifications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>复杂性尽量封装在模块里面，不要暴露出来。如果多个模块耦合，那就把这些模块合并成一个。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a design decision is used across multiple modules, coupling them together.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>三、接口和实现</h2>

<p>模块分成接口和实现。接口要简单，实现可以复杂。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Modules are interface and implementation. The best modules are where interface is much simpler than implementation.</p>

<p>It's more important for a module to have a simple interface than a simple implementation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://www.wangbase.com/blogimg/asset/201809/bg2018091002.jpg" alt="" title="" /></p>

<p>好的 class 应该是"小接口，大功能"，糟糕的 class 是"大接口，小功能"。好的设计是，大量的功能隐藏在简单接口之下，对用户不可见，用户感觉不到这是一个复杂的 class。</p>

<p>最好的例子就是 Unix 的文件读写接口，只暴露了5个方法，就囊括了所有的读写行为。</p>

<p><img src="https://www.wangbase.com/blogimg/asset/201809/bg2018091003.jpg" alt="" title="" /></p>

<h2>四、减少抛错</h2>

<p>有些软件设计者喜欢抛错，一遇到问题，就抛出一个 Exception。这也导致了复杂性，用户必须面对所有的 Exception。"反正我告诉你出错了，怎么解决是你的事。"</p>

<p>正确的做法是，除了那些必须告诉用户的错误，其他错误尽量在软件内部处理掉，不要抛出。</p>

<p><img src="https://www.wangbase.com/blogimg/asset/201809/bg2018091004.jpg" alt="" title="" /></p>

<p>Tcl 语言的最初设计是，unset() 方法用来删除已经存在的变量，如果变量不存在，该方法抛错。Ousterhout 教授说，这个设计是一个错误，完全不应该抛错，只要把 unset() 定义成让一个变量不存在，就解决问题了。</p>

<p><img src="https://www.wangbase.com/blogimg/asset/201809/bg2018091007.jpg" alt="" title="" /></p>

<p>另一个例子是，Windows 系统不能删除已经打开的文件，会有错误提醒。这也是一个设计错误，有些用户实在删不掉这些文件，不得不重启系统。Unix 的做法是，总是允许用户删除文件，但是不清理内存，已经打开的文件在内存里面继续存在，因此不会干扰其他程序的运行，那些程序退出保存文件的时候，发现文件不存在才会报错。这个设计比较好。</p>

<p>（完）</p>

                <p>When the App Store for iMessage in late 2016 went live, I , a sticker app with animated kaomoji inside. Ever since the release of this app, I wanted to write up a tutorial about how a simple text character like shruggie (i.e. <code>¯&#92;_(ツ)_&#47;¯</code>) can be animated to give it life-like features: </p>

<figure>)</figcaption></figure>

<p>What you are going to read in this article is a step-by-step guide of setting up a canvas in After Effects and then going through with the animation. You’ll also read about how well the app containing more than 30 animated stickers worked and what some of the specific issues are you might be having on the App Store for iMessage:</p>

<h3 id="canvas-setup">1. Canvas Setup</h3>

<p>We’re starting with setting up a new composition (<kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd>) within After Effects with the following settings:</p>

<ul>
<li>1000px &times; 1000px;</li>
<li>a frame rate of 30 frames per second;</li>
<li>a quarter on resolution;</li>
<li>a run time of 2 seconds.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is going to be the basic canvas we’re going to work with during the animation. We’re choosing a square since that is what you have to deal with within iMessage and Apple’s sticker implementation.</p>

<figure>)</figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="working-with-a-text-layer">2. Working With A (Text) Layer</h3>

<p>Since kaomoji are simple text-based emoticons we’re going to copy-paste a a Shruggie “<code>¯&#92;_(ツ)_&#47;¯</code>” from the first source we can find being .</p>

<p>After having found it on Emojipedia we’re pasting it as a text layer into After Effects. It’s time to utilise the <strong>text tool</strong>.</p>

<h4>The Text Tool</h4>

<p>Copy <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd> in with <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>:</p>

<figure>)</figcaption></figure>

<p>The Shruggie inside your canvas might not look exactly the way you’ve found him on Google, or on Emojipedia for that matter, that’s because of differences in font types. We’ve chosen a font that makes Shruggie look decent and made him stretch across the canvas to prepare him for his facelift: double-click on the <em>Source Name</em> to select all characters.</p>

<h4>The Character Menu</h4>

<p>Double click <em>Name Source</em> and then get the font type in your <em>Character</em> menu.</p>

<figure>)</figcaption></figure>

<h4>Scaling A Layer</h4>

<p>Select <em>Layer</em>, then <kbd>S</kbd> + <em>Scale</em> (by sliding right for example).</p>

<p>To position the layer properly, we’re scaling it up to fill the canvas by selecting the layer by pressing <kbd>S</kbd>, then <em>Scale</em> and then finally moving the scale until it fits.</p>

<figure>)</figcaption></figure>

<p>To further explore some smaller tweaks let’s look into making our Shruggie a little more connected. For that we’re looking into some <strong>kerning and height options</strong>. To adjust the gap between Shruggie’s arm and hand, we’ll use the kerning tool (V/A) either manually in the menu or with another keyboard shortcut:</p>

<h4>Kerning</h4>

<p>Select <kbd>Space</kbd> + <kbd>ALT</kbd> + <kbd>&larr; &rarr;</kbd>. When we’re happy with the kerning gaps, we’ll adjust the height of the arms and make it look like the arms are actually connected. To join up the slashes with the underscore we’re going to play around with increasing the height of the slash/vertical scale, moving it vertically and potentially adjusting the baseline. In our case we’ve increased the height of the slash character to 120% and then adjusted vertically:</p>

<figure>)</figcaption></figure>

<h4>Moving Vertically</h4>

<p>Make selection + <kbd>ALT</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>&uarr; &darr;</kbd></p>

<figure>)</figcaption></figure>

<p>If you repeat the steps above on the other side we’ll by now have a pretty looking Shruggie, but what’s that, we don’t like how it aligns at all, do we?</p>

<figure>)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Let’s further align this sorry looking Shruggie.</p>

<p>That’s what <strong>rulers</strong> are for.</p>

<div class="sponsors__wide-place"></div>




<h3 id="working-with-rulers">3. Working With Rulers</h3>

<p>To conjure up rulers we’re going to use another keyboard shortcut:</p>

<h4>Display Rulers</h4>

<p><kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd></strong></p>

<p>This gives you the ruler view, from which you can practically drag rulers as visual cues into your canvas.</p>

<figure>)</figcaption></figure>

<p>The next steps are a repetition of what we’ve done before: we’re selecting the middle part and moving it down vertically to align with Shruggie’s arms, shoulders, and hands. It looks pretty good, but let’s double-check on that first impression by <strong>zooming in</strong>!</p>

<h4>Zoom in</h4>

<p>You can zoom in by pressing <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>+</kbd>, and also by pressing on the <kbd>,</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd> keys. In our case, we found we need to change it to properly align Shruggie’s face with his arms, which is another repetition of the above resizing and realigning skills.</p>

<p>Guess what? We’re now ready to animate! 🎊🎉🎈🚀🚀🚀🚀</p>

<figure>)</figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="understanding-the-puppet-pin-tool">4. Understanding The Puppet Pin Tool</h3>

<p>In order to animate our base Shruggie, we’re going to use the <strong>Puppet Pin Tool</strong>. Essentially it lets us work on any vector elements within After Effects, which includes our text assets. Let’s start:</p>

<h4>The Puppet Pin Tool</h4>

<p>Now what we’ll want to do is put pins where we want the joints to be: hands, elbows, shoulders, and so on. Press on <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> to do the trick:</p>

<figure>)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Keep adding joints until we have him fully pinned up and gotten a fully functional human torso:</p>

<figure>)</figcaption></figure>

<p>When you get a yellow highlight, that means that everything has been well done and After Effects recognizes the element as a vector and therefore you can place your pins. One thing that’s worth looking out for is to make sure that your pins/keyframes are at time 0 in your timeline at this stage:</p>

<figure>)</figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="animation-and-timeline">5. Animation And Timeline</h3>

<p>The key to doing this effectively is to start with your main poses. We’re going to start with our start and end poses in place. We can do that by <strong>copying the keyframes</strong> that have been set up by our puppet pins in the <strong>beginning to our end state</strong>. The reason for this is simple: this is the start and our default pose, that’s the pose we want to return to in order to get a coherent animation.</p>

<h4>Set Up Start And End Point</h4>

<p>Select the layout and press <kbd>U</kbd>, then copy-paste to the end state.</p>

<figure>)</figcaption></figure>

<p>As you can see it in in the gif above selecting the layout and pressing <kbd>U</kbd> returns every property of a layer that has keyframes as little diamonds. These little 💠 now also constitute your end state.</p>

<h4>Setting the Middle Stage</h4>

<p>In order to have a stage that we want to animate to and from, we’ll put that right in the middle:</p>

<figure>)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Now that we’re in the middle of our animation we’re going to make changes to our default state in such a way that we want to constitute our middle state:</p>

<p>This means we’re going to raise the shoulder puppet pin, get the elbow and arms a little closer to your body and give the hand a proper “shrug” movement. This will automatically create those keyframes at that point in time, which will then animate our two default stages between each other.</p>

<p>Here’s the demonstration of the animation we get when we manually move the timeline with our cursor:</p>

<figure>)</figcaption></figure>

<p>We’re following the exact same process for the right part of Shruggie’s shoulder and then add a bit of movement to Shruggies face which gives him a distinct look smirking over his shoulders and giving us the impression of: “Meh, you know, nothing to do about that”.</p>

<h4>Space Bar To Play</h4>

<p>Select layer + <kbd>Space</kbd>. When you hit the <kbd>Space</kbd> key you can get a first impression of our animation:</p>

<figure>)</figcaption></figure>

<p>What you’ll notice immediately is that the character seems to miss character. That is mostly due to the fact that our animation plays at the same speed for the entire two seconds. That is the hallmark of mostly dodgy animation &mdash; you’ll want it to not just evenly move between two points.</p>

<p>The easiest way to fix it up and give Shruggie a bit more realism, believability is to use a technique called ease-in and ease-out (or cushioning or a number of other ways). It’s basically speeding up the animation and then speeding it down again before reaching the end of the animation timeline.</p>

<p>It’s a cheap way of breathing some more life into our Shruggie. To do that we’re using a great little After Effects plugin called <em>Ease and wiz</em> that lets us apply some easing without much work:</p>

<p>Select all keyframes and then apply <em>Ease and wizz</em> with the options most suitable for your animation.</p>

<figure>)</figcaption></figure>

<p>In our case we’ve chosen to go with the following settings:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Easing:</strong> <em>Quart</em></li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> <em>In and Out</em></li>
<li><strong>Keys:</strong> <em>All</em></li>
<li><strong>Curvaceous:</strong> <em>no</em></li>
</ul>

<p>If we now run our animation again with the space bar, you’ll notice you’ll get something very close to the animation embedded at the beginning of this post. This means that we’re done, and we can be very proud of our work.</p>

<h3 id="further-reading-and-tools">6. Further Reading About The Motion Basics</h3>

<p>The tutorial you’ve just read introduces only the very basics of animation by way of making Shruggie move. In order to progress in animation, you’ll need to dig in further into the basics of motion. Further reading on some of those basics will help you improve further.</p>

<p>Below you’ll find an article describing the basics of motion and then some that relate to motion/animation with UX and software to come back full circle on the web:</p>

<h3 id="bonus-reading">7. Bonus Reading: Life On The App Store For iMessage</h3>

<p>The above tactics were applied to a  for the already mentioned as stated in the introduction.</p>

<p>I’ve launched the sticker app to some early support on Product Hunt, however, the app itself failed to be picked up by Apple or any audience on the App Store at large. I’d like to point out two realities on the App Store that anyone trying to make a sticker app needs to face:</p>

<ul>
<li>Competition by big brands;</li>
<li>The wrath of users who don’t get the concept of stickers.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Problem: Prevalence Of Brands</h4>

<p>If you want a shot at being consistently in the top 50 of the top paid iMessage stickers, then it helps to be a big brand or a notoriously known character. I’m not going to attach much meaning to this, just state it as a fact and provide the evidence below of screenshots collected in April 2018 (when I first wrote the draft on this article) on the Swiss App Store for iMessage.</p>

<p>Of the top 40 (that’s the <strong>top paid</strong> category), around 18 are likely to be well known characters turning that fact into downloads:</p>

<h5>Top Paid Sticker Apps</h5>

<p>The subtitle of this section is somewhat provocatively chosen, as there is no intrinsic problem with this as these characters are uniquely suited for stickers, though it’s an issue as this is just what you’re up against. Of course, the economic reality also shows around curation:</p>

<p>The left shows a screenshot of the first batch of curated stickers (66% big brand) in April of 2018, the right shows a screenshot of late August of 2018, where I encountered the exact same setup.</p>

<p>Again, this is not to pass judgment at Apple as I think they’ve become much better at curation in the App Store in general. As a summary of this situation, I think it is fair to say that other sticker ecosystems such as LINE’s have allowed more creativity to flourish and that the sticker ecosystem on the App Store is hard to advance into successfully.</p>

<p>Users still don’t get (or do not want?) stickers and the next point is a testament to this:</p>

<h4>Problem: Facing The Wrath Of Users</h4>

<p>The most annoying problem with the App Store for iMessage is still the fact that users do not know how to use them (i.e. stickers). That results in an abundance of one-star reviews.</p>

<p>In the case of Korea, Kaomotion got 80 one-star reviews in a matter of a few days by users complaining about the app not being there on their phone.</p>

<p>They’re essentially all saying the same: “The App isn’t on our phone.” Any one-star reviews are essentially also going to stay forever as no-one seems to care about what you have to say.</p>

<h4>Solutions to the discoverability problem of stickers in the interface</h4>

<p>I’m not the first one or the only one , however I’d like to offer some possible remedies below.</p>

<p>18 months after the introduction of the App Store for iMessage users still don’t know how to send and receive stickers (though I must say that Apple tried to stitch the interface up within iMessage).</p>

<p>In this regard, you can only try to fix these problems by attacking the problem head-on and giving as much information as possible to users.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Writing guides on the App Store page</strong><br />Use the (text) screen real estate Apple gives you to write a step to step guide about how stickers are sent.</li>
<li><strong>Writing more in-depth guides elsewhere</strong><br />Do a blog post or something similar about the same topic with screenshots, gifs, or a video ().</li>
<li><strong>Use a screenshot or app preview</strong><br />Finally, you may want to be explicit even on your screenshots about how your app is used. <em>Even Wonder Woman</em> seems to have been experiencing the same problem and used a screenshot to offer remedy:</li>
</ul>

<p>You will likely still get users complaining, this way you’ll have an easy way to describe to them what needs to be done in order to use your stickers.</p>

<p>Were I to go back to the launch of the sticker store, I probably wouldn’t go through the hardship of creating Kaomotion once again, however, I’m glad I got to write about animation basics for After Effects!</p>

<p>I hope this tutorial gave you an interesting glimpse at both After Effects and the iMessage App Store. If you’re into this, you might want to go hang out at this new animation community called .</p>
