                <p><p>With the latest studies and official reports out this week, it seems that to avoid an irreversible climate change on Planet Earth, we need to act drastically within the next ten years. This rose a couple of doubts and assumptions that I find worth writing about.</p>
<p>One of the arguments I hear often is that and that climate change is “the big companies’ fault”. However, we as the consumers are the ones who make the decisions what we buy and from whom, whose products we use and which ones we avoid. And by choosing wisely, <strong>we can make a change</strong>. By talking to other people around you, by convincing your company owner to switch to renewable energy, for example, we can transform our society and economy to a more sustainable one that doesn’t harm the planet as much. It will be a hard task, of course, but we can’t deny our individual responsibility.</p>
<p>Maybe we should take this as an occasion to rethink , trying to understand the materials and their properties, helps us grasp how valuable the resources we currently have are — and what we would lose if we don’t care about our planet now.</p>

<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
<li>Max Böck wrote about the  and what we can do to keep users up-to-date even when bandwidth and battery are limited. Interestingly, CNN and NPR provided text-only pages during Hurricane Florence to serve low traffic that doesn’t drain batteries. It would be amazing if we could  move the default websites towards these goals — saving power and bandwidth — to improve not only performance and load times but also help the environment and make users happier.</li>
</ul>
<h3>UI/UX</h3>
<ul>
<li>In episode 42 of their podcast, the Nori team elaborates . The discussed content can be transferred to developers as well, so don’t be afraid to tune in despite the title.</li>
<li>Denislav Jeliazkov explains  and how they can be designed well to make a difference between your and your competitor’s app.</li>
<li>Jeremy Cherry on  and how UX can easily affect people’s health.</li>
<li>Shawn Park shares  for six years in a row and why he feels that this is an important step to improve your skills.</li>
<li>Jonas Downey wrote about  and why the only option we have is to vote against these patterns with our wallet and pay for software that doesn’t try to manipulate us in a way that affects our privacy, security, or mindset.</li>
<li> is a great collection of freely available fonts on Behance.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Accessibility</h3>
<ul>
<li>Accessibility is about more than making your website accessible for people with physical impairments. We shouldn’t forget that  is essential, too, if we want to serve our sites to as many people as possible.</li>
<li>Amy Leak .</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tooling</h3>
<ul>
<li> by Basecamp. If you’re using Ruby already, this might be a great choice for any content editing field in your application.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Privacy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Guess what? Our simple privacy-enhancing tools that delete cookies are useless . There are smarter ways to track a user via TLS session tracking, and we don’t have much power to do anything against it. So be aware that someone might be able to track you regardless of how many countermeasures you have enabled in your browser.</li>
<li>Josh Clark’s comment on university research about  is highlighting the most important parts about how important Android phone data is to Google’s business model and what type of information they collect even when your smartphone is idle and not moving location.</li>

<li>In his in-depth guide to debugging performance issues, Nolan Lawson shares how we can  and how the rendering pipeline of modern browsers works.</li>
<li>Philip Walton explains his  principle for optimizing the load and paint performance of websites.</li>
<li>How can we build a website that’s working well and is fast on low-tech devices while using as little resources as possible? The Low-Tech Magazine wanted to find out and . Neat additional fun fact: The website goes offline when there’s not enough sun to power the 2.5 Watt solar panel that powers the server.</li>
<li>The new Google  is out. Very useful when you want to analyze or debug performance.</li>

<h3>HTML &amp; SVG</h3>
<ul>
<li>As people can now browse the web on their Apple Watch, Marcus Herrmann shares insights into .</li>
<li>Modal windows usually include a lot of custom JavaScript, CSS, and HTML code. Now we have the <code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code> element which brings us most functionality out of the box, including accessibility. Chris Manning wrote an .</li>
</ul>
<h3>JavaScript</h3>
<ul>
<li>Willian Martins shares  function, a widely unknown operator that is so powerful and allows us to invoke <code>this</code> from somewhere else into named, non-anonymous functions. A different way to write JavaScript.</li>
<li>Everyone knows what the “9am rush hour” means. Paul Lewis uses the term to  and why we should try to avoid traffic jams on the main thread of the browser and outsource everything that doesn’t belong to the UI into separate traffic lanes instead.</li>

<h3>Work &amp; Life</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do you have a hobby? Well, when was the last time you enjoyed it and had enough time for it? Tim Wu reflects on how  .</li>
<li>Here is a primer for employees on  and positions.</li>
<li>We’ve all heard a lot about how David Heinemeier Hansson from Basecamp thinks differently about work, employment, and success.  the “Basecamp way” and the challenges which are linked to it.</li>
<li>Seth Godin ponders about Apple’s and Amazon’s net ‘value’ of a trillion dollars and .</li>
<li>“The tech industry is growing at an exponential rate influencing society to the point that we are seeing the biggest shift, perhaps ever, in man-kind. Some tech services actually have billions of users. You read that right, not thousands, not millions, but BILLIONS of human beings using them regularly. It would be arrogant not to say that these services are forming our society and shaping our norms while their only objective was to keep the growth curve… growing.” — Anton Sten in “”</li>
<li>You’re working hard to finish that project in expectation that it’ll feel so good and relaxing when it’s live. Itamar Turner-Trauring shares why this way of thinking is wrong and .</li>
<li>Leo Babauta on  and some strategies to avoid these feelings and work happily instead.</li>

<h3>Going Beyond…</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the Netherlands, there’s now  (that’s just a bit more than one year from now). I love the idea and hope other countries will be inspired by it — Germany, for example, which currently moves its emission cut goals farther and farther into the future.</li>
<li>David Wolpert explains  and how we could make them vastly more efficient. But for that to happen, we need to understand the thermodynamics of computing better.</li>
<li>. Of course, it is. But the interesting point in this article about the Whatsapp founder who just told the world how unhappy he is having sold his service to Facebook is that it seems that he believed he could keep the control over his product.</li>
</ul>
<p>One more thing: I’m very grateful for all of you who helped raise  this month. I never got so much feedback from you and so much support. Thank you! Have a great month!</p>
