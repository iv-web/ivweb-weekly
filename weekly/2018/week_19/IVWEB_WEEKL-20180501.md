The wallpapers all come in versions with and without a calendar, so that you can continue using your favorites even after the month has ended. Speaking of favorites: As a special goodie, we also added a <strong>selection of May wallpapers from previous years</strong> that are too good to be forgotten. A big <em>thank-you</em> to everyone who participated. Now there’s only one question left open: Which one to choose?</p>

<h3 id="leaves-of-grass-05-2018">Leaves Of Grass</h3>
<p>&#147;For many, the month of May is the preferred month of the year. The nature blossoms, the birds sing, and leaves of grass sprout all around us. Coincidentally, this is the month at the end of which the poet Walt Whitman was born. As he said in his famous poetry collection: ‘Spontaneous me, Nature, The loving day, the mounting sun, the friend I am happy with, The arm of my friend hanging idly over my shoulder.’ Sounds like a perfect setting to fly a kite — so, let’s get to it!&#148; &mdash; Designed by  from Novi Sad, Serbia.</p>

<h3 id="a-river-and-a-dream-05-2018">A River And A Dream</h3>
<p>&#147;A river with lush trees. Is it a dream? A beautiful sight in the middle of the Belgrade city. I can hear the music in the distance. Some retro sound. Earth, river, fresh air, the wind, blue sky, the music&hellip; I closed my eyes and the feeling of nostalgia for another time and adventurous spirit to travel around the world in a boat struck me suddenly. I opened my eyes slowly. Yes, the fisherman has finally caught the fish. You can’t ever feel unhappy strolling by the river and taking shots. Dream and be patient just like the fisherman, and maybe you will travel around the world in a boat.&#148; &mdash; Designed by  from Belgrade, Serbia.</p>

<p>&#147;May is the start of the summer adventure. Whether its traveling, outdoors, or sunshine, it is a time that brings smiles. I used three objects to portray this idea. The passport is a key to traveling, the sound of bees and sight of them pollinating shows the outdoors, and the glasses represent the summer sunshine that is about to come.&#148; &mdash; Designed by  from Pottsville, PA.</p>

<p>&#147;Imagine going deep into the woods, feeling the plush green breath of nature. A space devoid of chaos and pollution. A luxury one could rarely afford in the current world. The land that remains today is unnatural, with huge tractors sprawling into, greedily craving for soil and more ‘convenience’ for humans. Deforestation surely represents one of the major concerns in global land use.&#148; &mdash; Designed by  from London.</p>
