                <p>For most of us, July is the epitome of summer. The time for spending every free minute outside to enjoy the sun and those seemingly <strong>endless summer days</strong>, be it in a nearby park, by a lake, or on a road trip, exploring unfamiliar places. So why not bring a bit of that summer joy to your desktop, too?</p>

<p>In this post, you’ll find <strong>free wallpapers for July 2018</strong> created by artists and designers from across the globe as it has been . Please note that some of the wallpapers come in two versions as usual (with and without a calendar for the month), while the best-of selection at the end of the post only covers the non-calendar versions. Have a great July — no matter what you have planned!</p>

<p>Please note that: </p>

<h3>July Favorites</h3>

<p>Lots of beautiful wallpapers have been created in the nine years since we embarked on our wallpapers adventure.

Each month a new fabulous collective noun is illustrated, printed and made into a desktop wallpaper.” — Designed by  from South Africa.</p>
