<p><strong>Re-inventing npmjs.com</strong><br />
http://blog.npmjs.org/post/172567815935/re-inventing-npmjscom<br />
Last week, the npmjs.com website received the most ambitious update in its history. We said “cheerio” to the old hapi-and jQuery-based website, and “hello” to a state-of-the-art web application based on Spife and React.</p>

<p><strong>Examples of everything new in ECMAScript 2016, 2017, and 2018</strong><br />
https://medium.freecodecamp.org/here-are-examples-of-everything-new-in-ecmascript-2016-2017-and-2018-d52fa3b5a70e<br />
In this article, I’ll cover all 18 features that are listed in the TC39’s finished proposals that were added in ES2016, ES2017, and ES2018 (final draft) and show them with useful examples.</p>

<p><strong>GitLab + Google Cloud Platform = simplified, scalable deployment</strong><br />
https://about.gitlab.com/2018/04/05/gke-gitlab-integration/<br />
Get super-simple deployment for your app with GitLab and Google Cloud Platform (GCP): thanks to our integration with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), you can now get CI/CD and Kubernetes deployment set up with just a few clicks.. Now everyone can get automatic code quality, security testing, and no-configuration deployment.</p>

<p><strong>Improved Docker Container Integration with Java 10</strong><br />
https://blog.docker.com/2018/04/improved-docker-container-integration-with-java-10/<br />
With the release of Java 10, the JVM now recognizes constraints set by container control groups (cgroups). Both memory and cpu constraints can be used manage Java applications directly in containers, these include: adhering to memory limits set in the container; setting available cpus in the container; setting cpu constraints in the container. Java 10 improvements are realized in both Docker for Mac or Windows and Docker Enterprise Edition environments.</p>

<p><strong>当 Egg 遇到 TypeScript</strong><br />

本文主要阐述：应用层 TS 开发规范；我们在工具链方面的支持，是如何来解决上述问题，让开发者几乎无感知并保持一致性的开发体验。</p>

<p><strong>F2 3.1 发布，开箱即用的移动端可视化解决方案</strong><br />
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/35209259<br />
F2，源于 Fast &amp; Flexible 两个单词首字母，是 AntV 家族中专为移动端定制、开箱即用的可视化解决方案。或许大家对我比较陌生，但是从 AntV 上线的那一天起我就已经出道了，那时候我有另外一个名字『G2-mobile』，我和 G2 师承一脉，尽得『图形语法』真传，主要用于满足对代码体积以及渲染性能要求严苛的移动端图表需求。</p>

<p><strong>Node全栈为前端带来更多可能</strong><br />
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzUxMzcxMzE5Ng==&amp;mid=2247488622&amp;idx=1&amp;sn=ace22c286a261645e2c07a7adf90abf9<br />
Node 为解决后端并发而生，但却无心插柳，成为大前端的基石。伴随大前端的发展，Node 也发展得越来越好，越来越重要，其应用场景从脚手架、辅助前端开发（比如 SSR、PWA 等）的快速开发实践，到 API 中间层、代理层，到专业的后端开发都有非常成熟的经验。另外，前端越来越复杂，后端服务化，今日的前端要面临更多的挑战，Node 全栈给大家更多可能，狼叔对此坚定不移。<br />

<p><strong>Aurelia 2018 Q1 Report</strong><br />
http://aurelia.io/blog/2018/04/02/aurelia-2018-q1-report/<br />
With the first quarter of 2018 now behind us, we wanted to take the time to provide an update on the progress the Aurelia team and community have made towards our 2018 roadmap goals. We’ve made some significant advancements in our core platform capabilities during Q1, including releases that have been in high demand for quite some time. Let’s dig into the details…<br />

<p><strong>Scaling Uber’s Hadoop Distributed File System for Growth</strong><br />
https://eng.uber.com/scaling-hdfs/<br />
Scaling our infrastructure while maintaining high performance was no easy feat. To accomplish this, Uber’s Data Infrastructure team massively overhauled our approach to scaling our HDFS by implementing several new adjustments and features, including  View File System (ViewFs), frequent HDFS version upgrades, NameNode garbage collection tuning, limiting the number of small files that filter through the system, an HDFS load management service, and a read-only NameNode replica. Read on to learn how Uber implemented these improvements to facilitate the continued growth, stability, and reliability of our storage system.</p>

<p><strong>How Ipdata Serves 25M API Calls From 10 Infinitely Scalable Global Endpoints</strong><br />
http://highscalability.com/blog/2018/4/2/how-ipdata-serves-25m-api-calls-from-10-infinitely-scalable.html<br />
Our users typically call our API on each page request on their websites to geolocate their users and localize their content. So this particular failure was directly impacting our users’ websites on the biggest sales day of the year.  This sequence of events and their inexplicable nature — cpu, mem and i/o were nowhere near capacity. As well as concerns on how well (if at all) we would scale, given our outage, were a big wake up call to rethink our existing infrastructure.</p>

<p><strong>Updating the NGINX Application Platform</strong><br />
https://www.nginx.com/blog/updating-nginx-application-platform/<br />
Today, our vision to simplify the journey to microservices takes a big step forward. We are announcing the upcoming availability of the next version of our flagship software, NGINX Plus R15, with exciting new features, and the upcoming launches of NGINX Unit 1.0 and NGINX Controller R1. Combined, these launches advance the NGINX Application Platform, a product suite that includes a load balancer, content cache, API gateway, WAF, and application server – all with centralized monitoring and management for monolithic apps, for microservices, and for transitional apps.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction to Computer Vision</strong><br />
https://blog.algorithmia.com/introduction-to-computer-vision/<br />
Computer Vision is the process of using machines to understand and analyze imagery (both photos and videos). While these types of algorithms have been around in various forms since the 1960’s, recent advances in Machine Learning, as well as leaps forward in data storage, computing capabilities, and cheap high-quality input devices, have driven major improvements in how well our software can explore this kind of content.</p>

视觉标示常能使某一产品从一堆产品中脱颖而出，这样看来，与其要求使用者进行操作行为，倒不如用些交流手段来给用户一些他们值得注意的暗示。标示物并不一直明确的存在但是它常在某个情况下以一种低调的暗示方式出现。标示物通过图标、排版样式、放大字体、颜色变化、动画以及其他一些表现形式来达到对外传递信息的目的。</p>

<p><strong>The Rise Of Intelligent Conversational UI</strong><br />
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/04/rise-intelligent-conversational-ui/<br />
The importance of Conversational UI cannot be understated, even if some of us wish it wasn’t happening. The most important advancement in Conversational UI has been Natural Language Processing (NLP). This is the field of computing that deals not with deciphering the exact words that a user said, but with parsing out of it their actual intent. If the bot is the interface, NLP is the brain. In this article, we’re going to take a look at why NLP is so important, and how you (yes, you!) can build your own.</p>

<p><strong>The Inside Story of Reddit’s Redesign</strong><br />
https://www.wired.com/story/reddit-redesign/<br />
For the past year and a half, Reddit and its new team of 20 designers have been refashioning the so-called “front page of the internet.” They’ve taken great pains to build on top of Reddit’s long legacy, rather than replacing it with something unfamiliar. They’ve argued about everything from the placement of the logo to the way moderators should style their communities to the dominant color on the site (red-orange, as it turns out). It’s been a slow, careful process that everyone takes extremely seriously. “If you redesign Reddit,” says Diego Perez, the company’s head of design, “you’re inherently changing the internet.”</p>

<p><strong>Introducing Network Error Logging</strong><br />
https://dcreager.net/nel/intro/<br />
Enter Network Error Logging (NEL), a new web platform spec that we’re working on in the W3C’s Web Performance Working Group. With NEL, you can instruct user agents to collect the same set of information that would appear in your server logs. Those instructions would apply to all requests to your server’s origin, regardless of how (and on which containing sites) those requests were initiated. And since the data is collected directly by the user agent, you should have visibility into all of your clients’ connection requests, not just those that made it to your serving infrastructure.</p>

<p><strong>The End of Windows</strong><br />
https://stratechery.com/2018/the-end-of-windows/<br />
The story of Windows’ decline is relatively straightforward and a classic case of disruption: The Internet dramatically reduced application lock-in; PCs became “good enough”, elongating the upgrade cycle; Smartphones first addressed needs the PC couldn’t, then over time started taking over PC functionality directly. Thus my assertion at the top, that the story of how Microsoft came to accept the reality of Windows’ decline is more interesting than the fact of Windows’ decline; this is how CEO Satya Nadella convinced the company to accept the obvious.</p>

美团，这家一向以执行力强而闻名的公司，再次彰显了其攻城掠地的偏执。如何才能看懂美团的商业扩张逻辑？王兴之所以说「上天」，美团之所以研究人工智能、大数据、云计算，都是因为它的 On-Demand 服务不仅要在外卖里以亿计算，而且还准备进入其他市场，如打车。<br />

                <p>(<em>This article is kindly sponsored by CoffeeCup Software</em>.) Alright, I’m going to get straight to the point. CSS Grid is important, really important, too important to be one of those "I’ll use it when all browsers support it" properties. That’s because, with CSS Grid, we can now be as creative with layout on the web as we can in print, without compromising accessibility, responsiveness, or usability.</p>

<p>If you’re at all serious about web design or development, you need to be serious about learning and using CSS Grid too. In this article I’m going to explain how to use one aspect, <strong>grid-template areas</strong>, a way of arranging elements that even a big, dumb mug like me can understand, and one that doesn’t get enough attention.</p>

<p>Now, you want to see some action and some code, I know that, but hold on one Goddam minute. Before you learn "how," I want to teach you "why" it’s important to make the kind of layouts we’ve seen in other media for decades, but have mostly been absent from the web.</p>

<h3>Feeling Frustrated</h3>

<p>I guess you’ve seen those "which one of these two layouts are you designing today?" tweets, lamenting the current state of design on the web. Even I’ve spoken about how web design’s lost its "soul." I bet you’ve also seen people use CSS Grid to recreate posters or pages from magazines. These technical demonstrations are cool, and they show how easy implementing complex layouts with CSS Grid can be when compared to other methods, but they don’t get to the bottom of why doing this stuff matters.</p>

<p>So what’s the reason? Why’s layout such an important part of design? Well, it all boils down to one thing, and that’s communication.</p>


<div class="c-garfield-the-cat">


<p>For what seems like forever, web designers have created templates, then filled them, with little consideration of the relationship between content and layout. I suppose that’s inevitable, given considerations for content management systems, our need to make designs responsive, and the limitations of the CSS properties we’ve used until now. Sure, we’ve made designs that are flexible, usable, but we’ve been missing a key piece of the puzzle, the role that layout plays in delivering a message.</p>

<p>If you’ve been around the block a few times, you’ll know the role color plays in setting the right tone for a design. I don’t need to tell you that type plays its part too. Pick the wrong typeface, and you run the risk of communicating ineffectively and leaving people feeling differently to how you intended.</p> 

<p>Layout &mdash; closely linked to aspects of typography like the ’measure’ &mdash; plays an equally important role. Symmetry and asymmetry, harmony and tension. These principles draw people to your content, guide them, and help them understand it more easily. That’s why crafting the right layout is as important as choosing the most appropriate typeface. Print designers have known this for years.</p>

<h3>Telling Stories Through Art Direction</h3>

<p>Art direction matters as much on the web as it does in other media, including print, and what I’m going to cover applies as much to promoting digital products as it does to telling stories.</p>

<p>What do you think of when you hear the term ’art direction?’ Do you think about responsive images, presenting alternative crops, sizes or orientations to several screen sizes using the &lt;picture&gt; element or ’sizes’ in HTML? They’ve become useful responsive design and art direction tools, but there’s more to web design than tools.</p>

<p>Do you think of those designers like  who sometimes art direct their writing by giving an entry its own, distinctive image, layout and typography. This gets us closer to understanding art direction, but images, layout, and typography are only the result of art direction, not the meaning of it.</p>

<p>So if art direction isn’t exactly those things, what exactly is it? In a sentence, it’s the art of distilling an essential, precise meaning or purpose from a piece of content &mdash; be that magazine article or a list of reasons why to use the coolest app from the hottest start-up &mdash; and conveying that meaning or purpose better by using design. We don’t hear much about art direction on the web, but it’s well established in another medium, perhaps the most memorable being magazines and to some extent newspapers.</p>

<p>I’m not old enough to remember first hand ’s work on Harpers Bazaar magazine from 1934 to 1958.</p>

<p>Art direction is so rarely discussed in relation to the web that you could be forgiven for thinking that it’s not relevant. Perhaps you see art direction as an activity that’s more suited to the print world than it is to the web? Some people might think of art direction as elitist in some way.</p>

<p>I don’t think that any of that’s true. Stories are stories, no matter where they’re told or through what medium. They may be thought-provoking like the ones published on , or they might be the story of your company and why people should do business with you. There’s the story of how your charity supports a good cause and why people should donate to it. Then there’s the story of your start-up’s new app and why someone should download it. With all of these stories, there’s a deeper message beyond just telling the facts about what you do or sell.</p>

<p>Art direction is about understanding those messages and deciding how best to communicate them through the organization and presentation of words and visuals. Is art direction relevant for the web? Of course. Art directors use design to help people better understand the significance of a piece of content, and that’s as important on the web as it is in print. In fact, the basic principles of art direction haven’t changed between print and digital.</p>

<p>I’d go further, by saying that art direction is essential to creating cohesive experiences across multiple channels, so that the meaning of a story isn’t lost in the gaps between devices and screen sizes.</p>

<p>David Hillman, formerly of The Guardian and New Statesman and designer of many other publications said:</p>

<blockquote>"In its best form, (art direction) involves the art director having a full and in-depth understanding of what the magazine says, and through design, influencing how it is said."</blockquote>

<p>My friend , coincidentally the former Creative Director at The Guardian also said:</p>

<blockquote>"Design is being in charge of the distribution of elements in space."</blockquote>

<p>CSS Grid makes being in charge of the distribution of elements more possible than ever before.</p>

<h3>Art Directing A Hardboiled Story</h3>

<p>I guess now is the time to get down to it, so I’m going to tell you how to put some of this to work in a series of <em>Hardboiled</em> examples. I’ll shine a flashlight on layout and how it helps storytelling and then give you the low down on how to develop one of these designs using CSS Grid.</p>

<p>First, the backstory. On the cover of my 2010 edition of <em>Hardboiled Web Design</em> (1), a mystery woman in a red dress (there’s always a woman in a red dress) is pointing a gun at our private dick. (Sheesh, I know that feeling.) By the  in 2015 (2), the story’s moved on and a shadow moves ominously across the door of our detective’s office. The door flies open, two villains burst in (3), and a fist fight ensues (4). Our mystery woman sure knows how to throw a punch and before you can say "kiss me, deadly" one villain’s tied to a chair and ready to spill the beans (5).</p>

<h4>Chapter Three</h4>

<p>I’ll start telling that story at the explosive moment when those two villains bust open the door. Now, if you’ve read Scott McCloud’s book ‘’ you’ll know that panel size affects how long people spend looking at an area, so I want to make the image of our bad guys as large as possible to maximise its impact (1). What the hoods don’t know is that our woman is waiting for them. I use layout to add tension by connecting their eye lines, (2) at the same time drawing a reader’s eyes to where the content starts.</p>

<h4>Chapter Four</h4>

<p>As the first villain bursts onto the scene, I use the left edge of the page, without margins, to represent the open door (1). As most of the action takes place on the right, I create a large spacial zone using the majority of the height and width of the page (2).</p> 

<p>Now, when fists fly in all directions, our layout needs to do the same, so my content comes from the top &mdash; where whitespace draws the eye down to the bold paragraph (3) &mdash; and from the left with the enormous headline (4). You might be wondering why I haven’t mentioned that smaller image in the top-right, but I’ll get to that in a minute.</p>

<h4>Chapter Five</h4>

<p>The fight’s over, and our detective is back in control, so on this final page I use a more structured layout to reflect the order that’s returned. Solid columns of justified text (1) with plenty of whitespace around them add to the feeling of calm. At the same time, the right aligned caption (2) feels edgy and uncomfortable, like the gunpoint interrogation that’s taking place.</p>

<h3>Getting My Dands Dirty</h3>

<p>It’s time for a confession. I’m not going to teach you everything you need to know about developing layouts using CSS Grid as there are plenty of smarter people who’ve done that before:</p>

<ul>
<li> by Rachel Andrew</li>
<li>Learn  with Wes Bos</li>
<li> by Chris House on CSS Tricks</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead, I’ll show you the inspiration for one grid, how I translated it into a (large screen) layout using columns and rows in CSS Grid, and then placed elements into the spacial zones created using the <strong>grid-template areas</strong> property. Finally, I’ll deconstruct and alter the design for smaller screen sizes.</p>

<h3>The Perfect Beat</h3>

<p>My inspiration for the layout I use came from this 1983 design by Neville Brody for <em>The Face Magazine</em>. I was drawn to how Brody cleverly created both horizontal and vertical axis and the large space occupied by the main image.</p>

</figure>


<p>In CSS Grid we define a grid module by giving it a name, then we place an element into either a single module or multiple adjacent modules &mdash; known as spacial zones &mdash; with the <strong>grid-template-areas</strong> property. Sounds complicated huh? No, not really. It’s one of the easiest and most obvious ways of using CSS Grid, so let’s get to work.</p>

<p>First things, first. I have five elements to position, and they are my "Kiss Me, Deadly" title, the largest ’banner’ image, main content, aside paragraph and two images, fig-1 and fig-2. My HTML looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;body&gt;
&lt;picture role="banner"&gt;&#8230;&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;h1 class="title">&#8230;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;main>&#8230;&lt;/main&gt;
&lt;aside>&#8230;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;img class="fig-1"&gt;
&lt;img class="fig-2"&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I wrote that markup in the order that makes most sense, just as I would when constructing a narrative. It reads like a dream on small screens and even without styles. I give each element a <strong>grid-area</strong> value that in a moment I’ll use to place it on my grid:</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">[role="banner"] { grid-area: banner; }
.title { grid-area: title; }
main { grid-area: main; }
aside { grid-area: aside; }
.fig-1 { grid-area: fig-1; }
.fig-2 { grid-area: fig-2; }
</code></pre>

<p>Your grid area values don’t necessarily need to reflect your element types. In fact, you can use any values, even single letters like a, b, c, or d.</p>

<p>Back with the grid, I add three rows to the columns I created earlier. The height of each row is automatically defined by the height of the content inside it:</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">body {
grid-template-rows: repeat(3, auto); }
</code></pre>

<p>Here’s where the magic happens. I literally draw the grid in CSS using the grid-template-areas property, where each period (.) represents one empty module:</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">body {
grid-template-areas:
".  .  .  .  ."
".  .  .  .  ."
".  .  .  .  ."; }
</code></pre>

<p>Now it’s time to position elements on that grid using the grid-area values I created earlier. I place each elements’ value into a module on the grid and if I repeat that value across multiple adjacent modules &mdash; either across columns or row, that element will expand across them to create a spacial zone. Leaving a period (.) will create an empty space:</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">body {
grid-template-areas:
".  aside  .  fig-2  fig-2"
"title  title  banner  banner  banner"
"fig-2  main  banner  banner  banner"; }
</code></pre>

<p>One more small detail before I finish the layout CSS. I want the content of the aside element to sit at the bottom &mdash; close to the title and leaving ample white space above it to draw someone’s eye down &mdash; so I use an align-self property that might be familiar from learning Flexbox, but with a new value of ’end.‘</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">aside { 
align-self: end; }
</code></pre>

<p>All that remains is to add a few other styles to bring the design to life, including a striking inverse color scheme and a bright, red accent that ties the word "Deadly" in the title to the color of our woman’s dress:</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">&lt;h1 class="title"&gt;Kiss Me, &lt;em&gt;Deadly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

<h3>Going Up In Smoke</h3>

<p>Now, I know you’ve been wondering about that smaller fight image, and I need to admit something.  made only one finished fists flying illustration for my <em>Hardboiled Shot</em> covers, but her sketches were too good to waste. I used CSS Grid to position an inverted version of one pencil sketch above the gun and rotated it with a CSS transform to form a cloud of smoke.</p>

<h3>Breaking It Down</h3>

<p>In this article, I’ve shown how to create a layout for large screens, but in reality, I start with a small one and then work up, using breakpoints to add or change styles. With CSS Grid, adapting a layout to various screen sizes is as easy as positioning elements into different grid-template areas. There are two ways that I can do this, first by changing the grid itself:</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">body { 
grid-template-columns: 50px repeat(2, 1fr); }

@media screen and (min-width : 48em) {
body { 
grid-template-columns: repeat(5, 1fr); }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The second, by positioning elements into different grid-template areas on the same grid:</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">body { 
grid-template-areas:
"fig-1  aside  aside  aside  aside"
"fig-1  title  title  title  title"
"banner  banner  banner  banner  banner"
"....  main  main  main  main"; }

@media screen and (min-width : 64em) {
body {
grid-template-areas:
"....  aside  ....  fig-2  fig-2"
"title  title  banner  banner  banner"
"fig-1  main  banner  banner  banner"; }
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Using CSS Grid Builder</h3>

<p>Grid template areas make developing art directed layouts so easy that even a flat-foot like me can do it, but if you’re the type that likes tools to do the dirty work,  from CoffeeCup Software might be just the thing for you. You may have used WYSIWYG editors before, so you might be remembering how lousy the code they spat out was. Let me stop you there. CSS Grid Builder outputs clean CSS and accessible markup. Maybe not as clean as you write yourself, but pretty damn close, and the small team who developed it plan to make it even better. My handwritten HTML looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">&lt;picture role="banner"&gt;
    &lt;source srcset="banner.png" media="(min-width: 64em)"&gt;
    &lt;img src="banner-small.png" alt="Kiss Me, Deadly"&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The CSS Grid Builder &lt;picture&gt; element comes wrapped in an extra division, with a few other elements thrown in for good measure:</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">&lt;div class="responsive-picture banner" role="banner"&gt;
    &lt;picture&gt;
    &lt;!--[if IE 9]&gt;&lt;video style="display: none;"&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;
    &lt;source srcset="banner.png" media="(min-width: 64em)"&gt;
    &lt;!--[if IE 9]&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;
    &lt;img alt="Kiss Me, Deadly" src="banner-small.png"&gt;
    &lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Like I said, close enough, and if you don’t believe me,  from my <em>Hardboiled</em> example. Maybe that’ll convince you.</p>

<p>Browsers’ developer tools are getting better at inspecting grids, but CSS Grid Builder helps you build them. Obviously. At its core, CSS Grid Builder is a Chromium-based browser wrapped in a user-interface, and it runs on macOS and Windows. That means that if the browser can render it, the UI tools can write it, with one or two notable exceptions including CSS Shapes.</p>

<p>In fact, CSS Grid Builder builds more than grids, and you can use it to create styles for backgrounds &mdash; including <strong>gradients</strong>, which is very handy &mdash; borders, and <strong>typography</strong>. It even handles <strong>Flexbox and multi-column layouts</strong>, but you’re here because you want to learn about CSS Grid.</p>

<h3>Looking Around The Interface</h3>

<p>The interface in CSS Grid Builder, is pretty much as you’d expect it, with a wide area for the design you’re making on the left and controls over on the right. Those controls include common elements; text, images, interactive buttons and form controls, and layout containers.

All very useful, but it’s the layout section &mdash; somewhat inconveniently tucked away at the bottom of the pane &mdash; that’s the most interesting.</p>

<p>In this section you can design a grid. Setting up columns and rows to form a layout without visual representation can be one of the hardest parts of learning how ‘grid’ works. The app’s ability to visually define the grid structure is a handy feature, especially when you’re new to CSS Grid. This is the section I’m going to explain.</p>

</figure>


<p>Using CSS Grid Builder I added a container division. When selecting that in the work area, I get access to the Grid Editor. Activate that, and all the tools needed to visually build a grid are there:</p>
    

<ul>
<li>Add columns and rows</li>
<li>Align and justify content and items within each module</li>
<li>Size columns and rows using every type of unit including fr and minmax</li>
<li>Specify gaps</li>
<li>Name grid-template-areas</li>
<li>Specify breakpoints</li>
</ul>

<p>When I’m happy with those settings, "OK" the changes and they’re applied to the design in the work area. Back there, use sliders to preview the results at various breakpoints, and if you’re one of those people who’s worried about the shrinking percentage of people using incapable browsers, CSS Grid Builder also offers settings where you can figure fallbacks. Then just copy and paste CSS styles to somewhere else in your project or export the whole kit and caboodle.</p>

<h3>Cleaning Up</h3>

<p>I’m finding it hard to contain my excitement about CSS Grid. Yes, I know I should get out more, but I really do think that it offers us the best chance yet of learning lessons from other media to make the websites we create better at communicating what we aim to convey to our audiences. Whether we make websites for businesses who want to sell more, charities who need to raise more money through donations to good causes, or news outlets who want to tell stories more effectively, CSS Grid plus thoughtful, art directed content makes that all possible.</p>

<p>“Accessibility is solved at the design stage.” This is a phrase that  and his team heard over and over again while attending a conference. To design for accessibility means to <strong>be inclusive to the needs of your users</strong>. This includes your target users, users outside of your target demographic, users with disabilities, and even users from different cultures and countries. Understanding those needs is the key to crafting better and more accessible experiences for them.</p>

<p>One of the most common problems when designing for accessibility is knowing what needs you should design for. It’s not that we intentionally design to exclude users, it’s just that “.” So, when it comes to accessibility, there’s a lot to know.</p>

<p>How do we go about understanding the myriad of users and their needs? How can we ensure that their needs are met in our design? To answer these questions, I have found that it is helpful to apply a critical analysis technique of viewing a design through different lenses.</p>

<blockquote>“Good [accessible] design happens when you view your [design] from many different perspectives, or lenses.”<br /><br />&mdash; </blockquote>

<p>A  is “a narrowed filter through which a topic can be considered or examined.” Often used to examine works of art, literature, or film, lenses ask us to leave behind our worldview and instead view the world through a different context.</p>

<p>For example,  asks us to understand the “social, political, economic, cultural, and/or intellectual climate of the time.” This allows us to better understand what world influences affected the artist and how that shaped the artwork and its message.</p>

<p>Accessibility lenses are a filter that we can use to understand how different aspects of the design affect the needs of the users. Each lens presents a set of questions to ask yourself throughout the design process. By using these lenses, you will become more inclusive to the needs of your users, allowing you to design a more accessible user experience for all.</p>

<p>The <em>Lenses of Accessibility</em> are:</p>

<ul>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
</ul>

<p>You should know that not every lens will apply to every design. While some can apply to every design, others are more situational. What works best in one design may not work for another.</p>

<p>The questions provided by each lens are merely a tool to help you understand what problems may arise. As always, you should test your design with users to ensure it’s usable and accessible to them.</p>

<h3 id="lens-animation-effects">Lens Of Animation And Effects</h3>

<p>Effective animations can help bring a page and brand to life, guide the users focus, and help orient a user. But animations are a double-edged sword. Not only can misusing animations cause confusion or be distracting, but they can also be potentially deadly for some users.</p>

<p>Fast flashing effects (defined as flashing more than three times a second) or high-intensity effects and patterns can cause seizures, known as ‘.</p>

<p>Other effects, such as parallax or motion effects, can cause some users to feel dizzy or experience vertigo due to .</p>

<blockquote>“Imagine a world where your internal gyroscope is not working properly. Very similar to being intoxicated, things seem to move of their own accord, your feet never quite seem to be stable underneath you, and your senses are moving faster or slower than your body.”<br /><br />&mdash; </blockquote>

<p>Constant animations or motion can also be distracting to users, especially to users who have difficulty concentrating. GIFs are notably problematic as our eyes are drawn towards movement, making it easy to be distracted by anything that updates or moves constantly.</p>

<p>This isn’t to say that animation is bad and you shouldn’t use it. Instead you should understand why you&rsquo;re using the animation and . Generally speaking, you should try to design animations that cover small distances, match direction and speed of other moving objects (including scroll), and are relatively small to the screen size.</p>

<p>You should also provide controls or options to cater the experience for the user. For example,  as both a global setting and on a per image basis.</p>

<p>To use the <em>Lens of Animation and Effects</em>, ask yourself these questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are there any effects that could cause a seizure?</li>
<li>Are there any animations or effects that could cause dizziness or vertigo through use of motion?</li>
<li>Are there any animations that could be distracting by constantly moving, blinking, or auto-updating?</li>
<li>Is it possible to provide controls or options to stop, pause, hide, or change the frequency of any animations or effects?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lens-audio-video">Lens Of Audio And Video</h3>

<p>Autoplaying videos and audio can be pretty annoying. Not only do they break a users concentration, but they also force the user to hunt down the offending media and mute or stop it. As a general rule, don’t autoplay media.</p>

<blockquote>“Use autoplay sparingly. Autoplay can be a powerful engagement tool, but it can also annoy users if undesired sound is played or they perceive unnecessary resource usage (e.g. data, battery) as the result of unwanted video playback.”<br /><br />&mdash; </blockquote>

<p>You&rsquo;re now probably asking, “But what if I autoplay the video in the background but keep it muted?” While  may be a growing trend in today’s web design, background videos suffer from the same problems as GIFs and constant moving animations: they can be distracting. As such, you should provide controls or options to pause or disable the video.</p>

<p>Along with controls, videos should have transcripts and/or subtitles so users can consume the content in a way that works best for them. Users who are visually impaired or who would rather read instead of watch the video need a transcript, while users who aren’t able to or don’t want to listen to the video need subtitles.</p>

<p>To use the <em>Lens of Audio and Video</em>, ask yourself these questions:</p>

<h3 id="lens-color">Lens Of Color</h3>

<p>Color plays an important part in a design. Colors evoke emotions, feelings, and ideas. Colors can also help strengthen a brand’s message and perception. Yet the power of colors is lost when a user can’t see them or perceives them differently.</p>

<p>. Deuteranopia (red-green color blindness) is the most common form of color blindness, affecting about 6% of men. Users with red-green color blindness typically perceive reds, greens, and oranges as yellowish.</p>

<p>Color meaning is also problematic for international users. .</p>

<p>Because colors and their meanings can be lost either through cultural differences or color blindness, you should always add a non-color identifier. Identifiers such as icons or text descriptions can help bridge cultural differences while patterns work well to distinguish between colors.</p>

<p>Oversaturated colors, high contrasting colors, and even just the color yellow can be , prominently those on the autism spectrum. It’s best to avoid high concentrations of these types of colors to help users remain comfortable.</p>

<p>Poor contrast between foreground and background colors make it harder to see for users with low vision, using a low-end monitor, or who are just in direct sunlight. All text, icons, and any focus indicators used for users using a keyboard should meet a  of 4.5:1 to the background color.</p>

<p>You should also ensure your design and colors work well in different settings of . A common pitfall is that text becomes invisible on certain high contrast mode backgrounds.</p>

<p>To use the <em>Lens of Color</em>, ask yourself these questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the color was removed from the design, what meaning would be lost?</li>
<li>How could I provide meaning without using color?</li>
<li>Are any colors oversaturated or have high contrast that could cause users to become overstimulated or uncomfortable?</li>

<h3 id="lens-controls">Lens Of Controls</h3>

<p>Controls, also called ‘,’ are any UI elements that the user can interact with, be they buttons, links, inputs, or any HTML element with an event listener. Controls that are too small or too close together can cause lots of problems for users.</p>

<p>Small controls are hard to click on for users who are unable to be accurate with a pointer, such as those with tremors, or those who suffer from reduced dexterity due to age. The default size of checkboxes and radio buttons, for example, can pose problems for older users. Even when a label is provided that could be clicked on instead, .</p>

<p>Controls that are too close together can cause problems for touch screen users. Fingers are big and difficult to be precise with. Accidentally touching the wrong control can cause frustration, especially if that control navigates you away or makes you lose your context.</p>

<p>Controls that are nested inside another control can also contribute to touch errors. , it also makes it easy to accidentally select the parent control instead of the one you wanted.</p>

<p>To give users enough room to accurately select a control, . This size also includes any padding the control has. So a control could visually be 24 by 24 pixels but with an additional 10 pixels of padding on all sides would bring it up to 44 by 44 pixels.</p>

<p>It’s also recommended that controls be placed far enough apart to reduce touch errors. Microsoft recommends at least 8 pixels of spacing while Google recommends controls be spaced at least 32 pixels apart.</p>

<p>Controls should also have a visible text label. Not only do screen readers require the text label to know what the control does, but it’s been shown that . This is especially important for form inputs and icons.</p>

<h3 id="lens-font">Lens Of Font</h3>

<p>In the early days of the web, we designed web pages with a , something that couldn’t be changed.</p>

<p>Technology today is very different than it was 20 years ago. Today, browsers can be used on any device of any size, from a small watch to a huge 4K screen. We can no longer use fixed font sizes to design our sites. Font sizes must be as responsive as the design itself.</p>

<p>Not only should the font sizes be responsive, but the design should be flexible enough to allow users to customize the font size, line height, or letter spacing to a comfortable reading level. Many users make use of .</p>

<p>The font itself should be easy to read. You may be wondering if one font is more readable than another. The truth of the matter is that the font doesn’t really make a difference to readability. Instead it’s the font style that plays an important role in a fonts readability.</p>

<p>, and all uppercase text are also difficult for users. Overall, larger text, shorter line lengths, taller line heights, and increased letter spacing can help all users have a better reading experience.</p>

<p>To use the <em>Lens of Font</em>, ask yourself these questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is the design flexible enough that the font could be modified to a comfortable reading level by the user?</li>
<li>Is the font style easy to read?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lens-images-icons">Lens Of Images and Icons</h3>

<p>They say, “A picture is worth a thousand words.” Still, a picture you can’t see is speechless, right?</p>

<p>Images can be used in a design to convey a specific meaning or feeling. Other times they can be used to simplify complex ideas. Whichever the case for the image, a user who uses a screen reader needs to be told what the meaning of the image is.</p>

<p>As the designer, you understand best the meaning or information the image conveys. As such, you should annotate the design with this information so it’s not left out or misinterpreted later. This will be used to create the alt text for the image.</p>

<p>, or how much textual information is already available that describes the information. It also depends on if the image is just for decoration, conveys meaning, or contains text.</p>

<blockquote>“You almost never describe what the picture looks like, instead you explain the information the picture contains.”<br /><br />&mdash; </blockquote>

<p>Since knowing how to describe an image can be difficult, there’s a  to help when deciding. Generally speaking, if the image is decorational or there’s surrounding text that already describes the image’s information, no further information is needed. Otherwise you should describe the information of the image. If the image contains text, repeat the text in the description as well.</p>

<p>Descriptions should be succinct. It’s recommended to use no more than two sentences, but aim for one concise sentence when possible. This allows users to quickly understand the image without having to listen to a lengthy description.</p>

<p>As an example, if you were to describe this image for a screen reader, what would you say?</p>

<p>Since we describe the information of the image and not the image itself, the description could be Vincent van Gogh’s <em>The Starry Night</em> since there is no other surrounding context that describes it. What you shouldn’t put is a description of the style of the painting or what the picture looks like.</p>

<p>If the information of the image would require a lengthy description, such as a complex chart, you shouldn’t put that description in the alt text. Instead, you should still use a short description for the alt text and then provide the .</p>

<p>This way, users can still get the most important information quickly but have the ability to dig in further if they wish. If the image is of a chart, you should repeat the data of the chart just like you would for text in the image.</p>

<p>If the platform you are designing for allows users to upload images, you should provide a way for the user to enter the alt text along with the image. For example,  when they upload an image to a tweet.</p>

<p>To use the <em>Lens of Images and Icons</em>, ask yourself these questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Does any image contain information that would be lost if it was not viewable?</li>
<li>How could I provide the information in a non-visual way?</li>
<li>If the image is controlled by the user, is it possible to provide a way for them to enter the alt text description?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lens-keyboard">Lens Of Keyboard</h3>

<p>Keyboard accessibility is among the most important aspects of an accessible design, yet it is also among the most overlooked.</p>

<p>There are many reasons why a user would use a keyboard instead of a mouse. Users who use a screen reader use the keyboard to read the page. A user with tremors may use a keyboard because it provides better accuracy than a mouse. Even power users will use a keyboard because it’s faster and more efficient.</p>

<p>A user using a keyboard typically uses the tab key to navigate to each control in sequence. A logical order for the tab order greatly helps users know where the next key press will take them. In western cultures, this usually means from left to right, top to bottom. Unexpected tab orders results in users becoming lost and having to scan frantically for where the focus went.</p>

<p>Sequential tab order also means that they must tab through all controls that are before the one that they want. If that control is tens or hundreds of keystrokes away, it can be a real pain point for the user.</p>

<p>By making the most important user flows nearer to the top of the tab order, we can help enable our users to be more efficient and effective. However, this isn’t always possible nor practical to do. In these cases, providing a way to quickly jump to a particular flow or content can still allow them to be efficient. This is why &ldquo;skip to content&rdquo; links are helpful.</p>

<p>A good example of this is Facebook which  that allows users to jump to specific sections of the site. This greatly speeds up the ability for a user to interact with the page and the content they want.</p>

<p>When tabbing through a design, focus styles should always be visible or a user can easily become lost. Just like an unexpected tab order, not having good focus indicators results in users not knowing what is currently focused and having to scan the page.</p>

<p>Changing the look of the default focus indicator can sometimes improve the experience for users. A good focus indicator doesn’t rely on color alone to indicate focus (Lens of Color), and should be distinct enough to easily allow the user to find it. For example, a blue focus ring around a similarly colored blue button may not be visually distinct to discern that it is focused.</p>

<p>Although this lens focuses on keyboard accessibility, it’s important to note that it applies to any way a user could interact with a website without a mouse. Devices such as mouth sticks, switch access buttons, sip and puff buttons, and eye tracking software all require the page to be keyboard accessible.</p>

<p>By improving keyboard accessibility, you allow a wide range of users better access to your site.</p>

<p>To use the <em>Lens of Keyboard</em>, ask yourself these questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What keyboard navigation order makes the most sense for the design?</li>
<li>How could a keyboard user get to what they want in the quickest way possible?</li>
<li>Is the focus indicator always visible and visually distinct?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lens-layout">Lens Of Layout</h3>

<p>Layout contributes a great deal to the usability of a site. Having a layout that is easy to follow with easy to find content makes all the difference to your users. A layout should have a meaningful and logical sequence for the user.</p>

<p>With the advent of CSS Grid, being able to change the layout to be more meaningful based on the available space is easier than ever. However,  for users who rely on the structural layout of the page.</p>

<p>The structural layout is what is used by screen readers and users using a keyboard. When the visual layout changes but not the underlying structural layout, these users can become confused as their tab order is no longer logical. If you must change the visual layout, you should do so by changing the structural layout so users using a keyboard maintain a sequential and logical tab order.</p>

<p>The layout should be resizable and flexible to a minimum of 320 pixels with no horizontal scroll bars so that it can be viewed comfortably on a phone. The layout should also be flexible enough to be zoomed in to 400% (also with no horizontal scroll bars) for users who need to increase the font size for a better reading experience.</p>

<p>Users using a screen magnifier . A screen magnifier only provides the user with a small view of the entire layout, so content that is related but far away, or changes far away from where the interaction occurred is hard to find and can go unnoticed.</p>

<figure>)</figcaption></figure>

<p>To use the <em>Lens of Layout</em>, ask yourself these questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Does the layout have a meaningful and logical sequence?</li>

<h3 id="lens-material-honesty">Lens Of Material Honesty</h3>

<p> that states that a material should be honest to itself and not be used as a substitute for another material. It means that concrete should look like concrete and not be painted or sculpted to look like bricks.</p>

<p>Material honesty values and celebrates the unique properties and characteristics of each material. An architect who follows material honesty knows when each material should be used and how to use it without tarnishing itself.</p>

<p>Material honesty is not a hard and fast rule though. . Like all values, you are allowed to break them when you understand them. As the saying goes, they are &ldquo;more what you&rsquo;d call &ldquo;guidelines&rdquo; than actual rules.&rdquo;</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>. A link is activated with the enter key, typically takes you to a different page, and has a special context menu on right click. Buttons are activated with the space key, used primarily to trigger interactions on the current page, and have no such context menu.</p>

<p>When a link is styled to look like a button or vise versa, a user could become confused as it does not behave and function as it looks. If the “button” navigates the user away unexpectedly, they might become frustrated if they lost data in the process.</p>

<blockquote>“At first glance everything looks fine, but it won’t stand up to scrutiny. As soon as such a website is stress‐tested by actual usage across a range of browsers, the façade crumbles.”<br /><br />&mdash; </blockquote>

<p>Where this becomes the most problematic is when a link and button are styled the same and are placed next to one another. As there is nothing to differentiate between the two, a user can accidentally navigate when they thought they wouldn’t.</p>

<p>When a component behaves differently than expected, it can easily lead to problems for users using a keyboard or screen reader.  is one such example.</p>

<p>Autocomplete is used to suggest or predict the rest of a word a user is typing. An autocomplete menu allows a user to select from a large list of options when not all options can be shown.</p>

<p>An autocomplete menu is typically attached to an input field and , keeping the focus inside the input field. When a user selects an option from the list, that option will override the text in the input field. Autocomplete menus are meant to be lists of just text.</p>

<p>The problem arises when an autocomplete menu starts to gain more behaviors. Not only can you select an option from the list, but you can edit it, delete it, or even expand or collapse sections. The autocomplete menu is no longer just a simple list of selectable text.</p>

<p>The added behaviors no longer mean you can just use the up and down arrows to select an option. Each option now has more than one action, so a user needs to be able to traverse two dimensions instead of just one. This means that a user using a keyboard could become confused on how to operate the component.</p>

<p>Screen readers suffer the most from this change of behavior as there is no easy way to help them understand it. A lot of work will be required to ensure the menu is accessible to a screen reader by using non-standard means. As such, it will might result in a sub-par or inaccessible experience for them.</p>

<p>To avoid these issues, it’s best to be honest to the user and the design. Instead of combining two distinct behaviors (an autocomplete menu and edit and delete functionality), leave them as two separate behaviors. Use an autocomplete menu to just autocomplete the name of a user, and have a different component or page to edit and delete users.</p>

<p>To use the <em>Lens of Material Honesty</em>, ask yourself these questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is the design being honest to the user?</li>
<li>Are there any elements that behave, look, or function as another element?</li>
<li>Are there any components that combine distinct behaviors into a single component? Does doing so make the component materially dishonest?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lens-readability">Lens Of Readability</h3>

<p>Have you ever picked up a book only to get a few paragraphs or pages in and want to give up because the text was too hard to read? Hard to read content is mentally taxing and tiring.</p>

<p>Sentence length, paragraph length, and complexity of language all contribute to how readable the text is. Complex language can pose problems for users, especially those with cognitive disabilities or who aren’t fluent in the language.</p>

<p>Along with using plain and simple language, you should ensure each paragraph focuses on a single idea. A paragraph with a single idea is easier to remember and digest. The same is true of a sentence with fewer words.</p>

<p>Another contributor to the readability of content is the length of a line. The ideal line length is often quoted to be between 45 and 75 characters. A line that is too long causes users to lose focus and makes it harder to move to the next line correctly, while a line that is too short causes users to jump too often, causing fatigue on the eyes.</p>

<blockquote>“The subconscious mind is energized when jumping to the next line. At the beginning of every new line the reader is focused, but this focus gradually wears off over the duration of the line”<br /><br />&mdash; Typographie: A Manual of Design</blockquote>

<p>You should also break up the content with headings, lists, or images to give mental breaks to the reader and support different learning styles. Use headings to logically group and summarize the information. Headings, links, controls, and labels should be clear and descriptive to enhance the users ability to comprehend.</p>

<p>To use the <em>Lens of Readability</em>, ask yourself these questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is the language plain and simple?</li>
<li>Does each paragraph focus on a single idea?</li>
<li>Are there any long paragraphs or long blocks of unbroken text?</li>
<li>Are all headings, links, controls, and labels clear and descriptive?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lens-structure">Lens Of Structure</h3>

<p>As mentioned in the Lens of Layout, the structural layout is what is used by screen readers and users using a keyboard. While the Lens of Layout focused on the visual layout, the Lens of Structure focuses on the structural layout, or the underlying HTML and semantics of the design.</p>


  <div id="sponsors-article" data-impression="true" class="c-promo-box c-promo-box--ad sponsors hidden" data-audience="non-subscriber" data-remove="true"></div>



<p>As a designer, you may not write the structural layout of your designs. This shouldn’t stop you from thinking about how your design will ultimately be structured though. Otherwise, your design may result in an inaccessible experience for a screen reader.</p>

<p>Take for example a design for a single elimination tournament bracket.</p>

<p>How would you know if this design was accessible to a user using a screen reader? Without understanding structure and semantics, you may not. As it stands, the design would probably result in an inaccessible experience for a user using a screen reader.</p>

<p>To understand why that is, we first must understand that a screen reader reads a page and its content in sequential order. This means that every name in the first column of the tournament would be read, followed by all the names in the second column, then third, then the last.</p>

<blockquote>“George, Fred, Linus, Lucy, Jack, Jill, Fred, Ginger, George, Lucy, Jack, Ginger, George, Ginger, Ginger.”</blockquote>

<p>If all you had was a list of seemingly random names, how would you interpret the results of the tournament? Could you say who won the tournament? Or who won game 6?</p>

<p>With nothing more to work with, a user using a screen reader would probably be a bit confused about the results. To be able to understand the visual design, we must provide the user with more information in the structural design.</p>

<p>This means that as a designer you need to know how a screen reader interacts with the HTML elements on a page so you know how to enhance their experience.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Landmark Elements</strong> (header, nav, main, and footer)<br />
Allow a screen reader to jump to important sections in the design.</li>
<li><strong>Headings</strong> (<code>h1</code> &rarr; <code>h6</code>)<br />
Allow a screen reader to scan the page and get a high level overview. Screen readers can also jump to any heading.</li>
<li><strong>Lists</strong> (<code>ul</code> and <code>ol</code>)<br />
Group related items together, and allow a screen reader to easily jump from one item to another.</li>
<li><strong>Buttons</strong><br />
Trigger interactions on the current page.</li>
<li><strong>Links</strong><br />
Navigate or retrieve information.</li>
<li><strong>Form labels</strong><br />
Tell screen readers what each form input is.</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing this, how might we provide more meaning to a user using a screen reader?</p>

<p>To start, we could group each column of the tournament into rounds and use headings to label each round. This way, a screen reader would understand when a new round takes place.</p>

<p>Next, we could help the user understand which players are playing against each other each game. We can again use headings to label each game, allowing them to find any game they might be interested in.</p>

<p>By just adding headings, the content would read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“__Round 1, Game 1__, George, Fred, __Game 2__, Linus, Lucy, __Game 3__, Jack, Jill, __Game 4__, Fred, Ginger, __Round 2, Game 5__, George, Lucy, __Game 6__, Jack, Ginger, __Round 3__, __Game 7__, George, Ginger, __Winner__, Ginger.”</blockquote>

<p>This is already a lot more understandable than before.</p>

<p>The information still doesn’t answer who won a game though. To know that, you&rsquo;d have to understand which game a winner plays next to see who won the previous game. For example, you&rsquo;d have to know that the winner of game four plays in game six to know who advanced from game four.</p>

<p>We can further enhance the experience by informing the user who won each game so they don’t have to go hunting for it. Putting the text &ldquo;(winner)&rdquo; after the person who won the round would suffice.</p>

<p>We should also further group the games and rounds together using lists. Lists provide the structural semantics of the design, essentially informing the user of the connected nodes from the visual design.</p>

<p>If we translate this back into a visual design, the result could look as follows:</p>

</figure>


<p>Since the headings and winner text are redundant in the visual design,  so the end visual result looks just like the first design.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the end result is visually the same as where we started, why did we go through all this?&rdquo; You may ask.</p>

<p>The reason is that you should always annotate your design with all the necessary structural design requirements needed for a better screen reader experience. This way, the person who implements the design knows to add them. If you had just handed the first design to the implementer, it would more than likely end up inaccessible.</p>

<p>To use the <em>Lens of Structure</em>, ask yourself these questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can I outline a rough HTML structure of my design?</li>
<li>How can I structure the design to better help a screen reader understand the content or find the content they want?</li>
<li>How can I help the person who will implement the design understand the intended structure?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lens-time">Lens Of Time</h3>

<p>Periodically in a design you may need to limit the amount of time a user can spend on a task. Sometimes it may be for security reasons, such as a session timeout. Other times it could be due to a non-functional requirement, such as a time constrained test.</p>

<p>Whatever the reason, you should understand that some users may need more time in order finish the task. Some users might need more time to understand the content, others might not be able to perform the task quickly, and a lot of the time they could just have been interrupted.</p>

<blockquote>“The designer should assume that people will be interrupted during their activities”<br /><br />&mdash; The Design of Everyday Things</blockquote>

<p>Users who need more time to perform an action should be able to adjust or remove a time limit when possible. For example, with a session timeout you could alert the user when their session is about to expire and allow them to extend it.</p>

<p>To use the <em>Lens of Time</em>, ask yourself this question:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is it possible to provide controls to adjust or remove time limits?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bringing-it-all-together">Bringing It All Together</h3>

<p>So now that you’ve learned about the different lenses of accessibility through which you can view your design, what do you do with them?</p>

<p>The lenses can be used at any point in the design process, even after the design has been shipped to your users. Just start with a few of them at hand, and one at a time carefully analyze the design through a lens.</p>

<p>Ask yourself the questions and see if anything should be adjusted to better meet the needs of a user. As you slowly make changes, bring in other lenses and repeat the process.</p>

<p>By looking through your design one lens at a time, you&rsquo;ll be able to refine the experience to better meet users&rsquo; needs. As you are more inclusive to the needs of your users, you will create a more accessible design for all your users.</p>

<p><em>Using lenses and insightful questions to examine principles of accessibility was heavily influenced by  and his book “The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses.”</em></p>

<p>Two months ago we shipped the  so much. Today we’re shipping our first minor release, v4.1! This release comes later than expected and some of the fixes we intended, but there’s still a boatload of fixes, docs updates, build tool changes, and even a few small new features.</p>

<h2 id="updated-docs-url">Updated docs URL</h2>

<p>With the release of v4 stable, we moved to a versioned docs setup, meaning each minor release would bring with it a new hosted version of our docs. This allows folks who haven’t yet upgraded stick to the docs they know and love and avoids breaking URLs across the web. With today’s release, our we’ll have a new URL for this release’s documentation, <code class="highlighter-rouge">getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/</code>. The previous URL, <code class="highlighter-rouge">getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/</code> will still work as y’all would imagine.</p>

<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

<p>Here’s what’s new in addition to our bug fixes and docs updates:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Added new custom range form control.</li>
