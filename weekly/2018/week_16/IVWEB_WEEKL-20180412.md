<p>Since iOS 5, Siri has helped iPhone users send messages, set reminders and look up restaurants with Apple’s apps. Starting in iOS 10, we have been able to use Siri in some of our own apps as well.</p>

<p>In order to use this functionality, your app must fit within Apple’s predefined Siri “domains and intents.” In this article, we’ll learn about what those are and see whether our apps can use them. We’ll take a simple app that is a to-do list manager and learn how to add Siri support. We’ll also go through the Apple developer website’s guidelines on configuration and Swift code for a new type of extension that was introduced with SiriKit: the <em>Intents</em> extension.</p>

<p>When you get to the coding part of this article, you will need Xcode (at least version 9.x), and it would be good if you are familiar with iOS development in Swift because we’re going to add Siri to a small working app. We’ll go through the steps of setting up a extension on Apple’s developer website and of adding the Siri extension code to the app.</p>

<h3 id="hey-siri-why-do-i-need-you">“Hey Siri, Why Do I Need You?”</h3>

<p>Sometimes I use my phone while on my couch, with both hands free, and I can give the screen my full attention. Maybe I’ll text my sister to plan our mom’s birthday or reply to a question in Trello. I can see the app. I can tap the screen. I can type.</p>

<p>But I might be walking around my town, listening to a podcast, when a text comes in on my watch. My phone is in my pocket, and I can’t easily answer while walking.</p>

<p>With Siri, I can hold down my headphone’s control button and say, “Text my sister that I’ll be there by two o’clock.” Siri is great when you are on the go and can’t give full attention to your phone or when the interaction is minor, but it requires several taps and a bunch of typing.</p>

<p>This is fine if I want to use Apple apps for these interactions. But some categories of apps, like messaging, have very popular alternatives. Other activities, such as booking a ride or reserving a table in a restaurant, are not even possible with Apple’s built-in apps but are perfect for Siri.</p>

<h3 id="apple-s-approach-to-voice-assistants">Apple’s Approach To Voice Assistants</h3>

<p>To enable Siri in third-party apps, Apple had to decide on a mechanism to take the sound from the user’s voice and somehow get it to the app in a way that it could fulfill the request. To make this possible, Apple requires the user to mention the app’s name in the request, but they had several options of what to do with the rest of the request.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>It could have sent a sound file to the app.</strong><br />
The benefit of this approach is that the app could try to handle literally any request the user might have for it. Amazon or Google might have liked this approach because they already have sophisticated voice-recognition services. But most apps would not be able to handle this very easily.</li>
<li><strong>It could have turned the speech into text and sent that.</strong><br />
Because many apps don’t have sophisticated natural-language implementations, the user would usually have to stick to very particular phrases, and non-English support would be up to the app developer to implement.</li>
<li><strong>It could have asked you to provide a list of phrases that you understand.</strong><br />
This mechanism is closer to what Amazon does with Alexa (in its “skills” framework), and it enables far more uses of Alexa than SiriKit can currently handle. In an Alexa skill, you provide phrases with placeholder variables that Alexa will fill in for you. For example, “Alexa, remind me at <code>$TIME$</code> to <code>$REMINDER$</code>” &mdash; Alexa will run this phrase against what the user has said and tell you the values for <code>TIME</code> and <code>REMINDER</code>. As with the previous mechanism, the developer needs to do all of the translation, and there isn’t a lot of flexibility if the user says something slightly different.</li>
<li><strong>It could define a list of requests with parameters and send the app a structured request.</strong><br />
This is actually what Apple does, and the benefit is that it can support a variety of languages, and it does all of the work to try to understand all of the ways a user might phrase a request. The big downside is that you can only implement handlers for requests that Apple defines. This is great if you have, for example, a messaging app, but if you have a music-streaming service or a podcast player, you have no way to use SiriKit right now.</li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly, there are three ways for apps to talk back to the user: with sound, with text that gets converted, or by expressing the kind of thing you want to say and letting the system figure out the exact way to express it. The last solution (which is what Apple does) puts the burden of translation on Apple, but it gives you limited ways to use your own words to describe things.</p>

<p>The kinds of requests you can handle are defined in SiriKit’s domains and intents. An intent is a type of request that a user might make, like texting a contact or finding a photo. Each intent has a list of parameters &mdash; for example, texting requires a contact and a message.</p>

<p>A domain is just a group of related intents. Reading a text and sending a text are both in the messaging domain. Booking a ride and getting a location are in the ride-booking domain. There are domains for making VoIP calls, starting workouts, searching for photos and a few more things. SiriKit’s documentation contains a .</p>

<p>A common criticism of Siri is that it seems unable to handle requests as well as Google and Alexa, and that the third-party voice ecosystem enabled by Apple’s competitors is richer.</p>

<p>I agree with those criticisms. If your app doesn’t fit within the current intents, then you can’t use SiriKit, and there’s nothing you can do. Even if your app does fit, you can’t control all of the words Siri says or understands; so, if you have a particular way of talking about things in your app, you can’t always teach that to Siri.</p>

<p>The hope of iOS developers is both that Apple will greatly expand its list of intents and that its natural language processing becomes much better. If it does that, then we will have a voice assistant that works without developers having to do translation or understand all of the ways of saying the same thing. And implementing support for structured requests is actually fairly simple to do &mdash; a lot easier than building a natural language parser.</p>

<p>Another big benefit of the intents framework is that it is not limited to Siri and voice requests. Even now, the Maps app can generate an intents-based request of your app (for example, a restaurant reservation). It does this programmatically (not from voice or natural language). If Apple allowed apps to discover each other’s exposed intents, we’d have a much better way for apps to work together, (as opposed to ).</p>

<p>Finally, because an intent is a structured request with parameters, there is a simple way for an app to express that parameters are missing or that it needs help distinguishing between some options. Siri can then ask follow-up questions to resolve the parameters without the app needing to conduct the conversation.</p>

<h3 id="the-ride-booking-domain">The Ride-Booking Domain</h3>

<p>To understand domains and intents, let’s look at the . This is the domain that you would use to ask Siri to get you a Lyft car.</p>

<p>Apple defines how to ask for a ride and how to get information about it, but there is actually no built-in Apple app that can actually handle this request. This is one of the few domains where a SiriKit-enabled app is required.</p>

<p>You can invoke one of the intents via voice or directly from Maps. Some of the intents for this domain are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Request a ride</strong><br />
Use this one to book a ride. You’ll need to provide a pick-up and drop-off location, and the app might also need to know your party’s size and what kind of ride you want. A sample phrase might be, “Book me a ride with &lt;appname&gt;.”</li>
<li><strong>Get the ride’s status</strong><br />
Use this intent to find out whether your request was received and to get information about the vehicle and driver, including their location. The Maps app uses this intent to show an updated image of the car as it is approaching you.</li>
<li><strong>Cancel a ride</strong><br />
Use this to cancel a ride that you have booked.</li>
</ul>

<p>For any of this intents, Siri might need to know more information. As you’ll see when we implement an intent handler, your Intents extension can tell Siri that a required parameter is missing, and Siri will prompt the user for it.</p>

<p>The fact that intents can be invoked programmatically by Maps shows how intents might enable inter-app communication in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>You can get a , including ride-booking.</em></p>

<h3 id="adding-lists-and-notes-domain-support-to-your-app">Adding Lists And Notes Domain Support To Your App</h3>

<p>OK, now that we understand the basics of SiriKit, let’s look at how you would go about adding support for Siri in an app that involves a lot of configuration and a class for each intent you want to handle.</p>

<p>The rest of this article consists of the detailed steps to add Siri support to an app. There are five high-level things you need to do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Prepare to add a new extension to the app by creating provisioning profiles with new entitlements for it on Apple’s developer website.</li>
<li>Configure your app (via its <code>plist</code>) to use the entitlements.</li>
<li>Use Xcode’s template to get started with some sample code.</li>
<li>Add the code to support your Siri intent.</li>
<li>Configure Siri’s vocabulary via <code>plist</code>s.</li>
</ol>

<p>Don’t worry: We’ll go through each of these, explaining extensions and entitlements along the way.</p>

<p>To focus on just the Siri parts, I’ve prepared a simple to-do list manager, List-o-Mat.</p>

<figure>)</figcaption></figure>

<p><em>You can find the .</em></p>

<p>To create it, all I did was start with the Xcode Master-Detail app template and make both screens into a <code>UITableView</code>. I added a way to add and delete lists and items, and a way to check off items as done. All of the navigation is generated by the template.</p>

<p>To store the data, I used the <code>Codable</code> protocol, (), which turns structs into JSON and saves it in a text file in the <code>documents</code> folder.</p>


  <div id="sponsors-article" data-impression="true" class="c-promo-box c-promo-box--ad sponsors hidden" data-audience="non-subscriber" data-remove="true"></div>



<p>I’ve deliberately kept the code very simple. If you have any experience with Swift and making view controllers, then you should have no problem with it.</p>

<p>Now we can go through the steps of adding SiriKit support. The high-level steps would be the same for any app and whichever domain and intents you plan to implement. We’ll mostly be dealing with Apple’s developer website, editing <code>plist</code>s and writing a bit of Swift.</p>

<p>For List-o-Mat, we’ll focus on the , which is broadly applicable to things like note-taking apps and to-do lists.</p>

<p>In the lists and notes domain, we have the following intents that would make sense for our app.</p>

<ul>
<li>Get a list of tasks.</li>
<li>Add a new task to a list.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because the interactions with Siri actually happen outside of your app (maybe even when you app is not running), iOS uses an extension to implement this.</p>

<h3 id="the-intents-extension">The Intents Extension</h3>

<p>If you have not worked with extensions, you’ll need to know three main things:</p>

<ol>
<li>An extension is a separate process. It is delivered inside of your app’s bundle, but it runs completely on its own, with its own sandbox.</li>
<li>Your app and extension can communicate with each other by being in the same app group. The easiest way is via the group’s shared sandbox folders (so, they can read and write to the same files if you put them there).</li>
<li>Extensions require their own app IDs, profiles and entitlements.</li>
</ol>

<p>To add an extension to your app, start by logging into your  and going to the “Certificates, Identifiers, &amp; Profiles” section.</p>

<h4 id="updating-your-apple-developer-app-account-data">Updating Your Apple Developer App Account Data</h4>

<p>In our Apple developer account, the first thing we need to do is create an app group. Go to the “App Groups” section under “Identifiers” and add one.</p>

<figure class="break-out">)</figcaption></figure>

<p>It must start with <code>group</code>, followed by your usual reverse domain-based identifier. Because it has a prefix, you can use your app’s identifier for the rest.</p>

<p>Then, we need to update our app’s ID to use this group and to enable Siri:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Go to the “App IDs” section and click on your app’s ID;</li>
    <li>Click the “Edit” button;</li>
    <li>Enable app groups (if not enabled for another extension).<br />
        <figure class="break-out">)</figcaption></figure>
    </li>
    <li>Then configure the app group by clicking the “Edit” button. Choose the app group from before.<br />
        <figure class="break-out">)</figcaption></figure>
    </li>
    <li>Enable SiriKit.<br />
        <figure class="break-out">)</figcaption></figure>
    </li>
    <li>Click “Done” to save it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, we need to create a new app ID for our extension:</p>

<ol>
    <li>In the same “App IDs” section, add a new app ID. This will be your app’s identifier, with a suffix. Do <em>not</em> use just <code>Intents</code> as a suffix because this name will become your module’s name in Swift and would then conflict with the real <code>Intents</code>.<br />
        <figure class="break-out">)</figcaption></figure>
    </li>
    <li>Enable this app ID for app groups as well (and set up the group as we did before).</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, create a development provisioning profile for the Intents extension, and regenerate your app’s provisioning profile. Download and install them as you would normally do.</p>

<p>Now that our profiles are installed, we need to go to Xcode and update the app’s entitlements.</p>

<p>Back in Xcode, choose your project’s name in the project navigator. Then, choose your app’s main target, and go to the “Capabilities” tab. In there, you will see a switch to turn on Siri support.</p>

<figure class="break-out">)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Further down the list, you can turn on app groups and configure it.</p>

<figure>)</figcaption></figure>

<p>If you have set it up correctly, you’ll see this in your app’s <code>.entitlements</code> file:</p>

<figure class="break-out">)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Now, we are finally ready to add the Intents extension target to our project.</p>

<h4 id="adding-the-intents-extension">Adding The Intents Extension</h4>

<p>We’re finally ready to add the extension. In Xcode, choose “File” &rarr; “New Target.” This sheet will pop up:</p>

<figure>)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Choose “Intents Extension” and click the “Next” button. Fill out the following screen:</p>

<figure class="break-out">)</figcaption></figure>

<p>The product name needs to match whatever you made the suffix in the intents app ID on the Apple developer website.</p>

<p>We are choosing not to add an intents UI extension. This isn’t covered in this article, but you could add it later if you need one. Basically, it’s a way to put your own branding and display style into Siri’s visual results.</p>

<p>When you are done, Xcode will create an intents handler class that we can use as a starting part for our Siri implementation.</p>

<h3 id="the-intents-handler-resolve-confirm-and-handle">The Intents Handler: Resolve, Confirm And Handle</h3>

<p>Xcode generated a new target that has a starting point for us.</p>

<p>The first thing you have to do is set up this new target to be in the same app group as the app. As before, go to the “Capabilities” tab of the target, and turn on app groups, and configure it with your group name. Remember, apps in the same group have a sandbox that they can use to share files with each other. We need this in order for Siri requests to get to our app.</p>

<p>List-o-Mat has a function that returns the group document folder. We should use it whenever we want to read or write to a shared file.</p>

<pre class="break-out"><code class="language-javascript">func documentsFolder() -> URL? {
    return FileManager.default.containerURL(forSecurityApplicationGroupIdentifier: "group.com.app-o-mat.ListOMat")
}
</code></pre>

<p>For example, when we save the lists, we use this:</p>

<pre class="break-out"><code class="language-javascript">func save(lists: Lists) {
    guard let docsDir = documentsFolder() else {
        fatalError("no docs dir")
    }

    let url = docsDir.appendingPathComponent(fileName, isDirectory: false)

    // Encode lists as JSON and save to url
}
</code></pre>

<p>The Intents extension template created a file named <code>IntentHandler.swift</code>, with a class named <code>IntentHandler</code>. It also configured it to be the intents’ entry point in the extension’s <code>plist</code>.</p>

<figure class="break-out"><figcaption>The intent extension plist configures IntentHandler as the entry point</figcaption></figure>

<p>In this same <code>plist</code>, you will see a section to declare the intents we support. We’re going to start with the one that allows searching for lists, which is named <code>INSearchForNotebookItemsIntent</code>. Add it to the array under <code>IntentsSupported</code>.</p>

<figure class="break-out">)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Now, go to <code>IntentHandler.swift</code> and replace its contents with this code:</p>

<pre class="break-out"><code class="language-javascript">import Intents

class IntentHandler: INExtension {
    override func handler(for intent: INIntent) -> Any? {
        switch intent {
        case is INSearchForNotebookItemsIntent:
            return SearchItemsIntentHandler()
        default:
            return nil
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>handler</code> function is called to get an object to handle a specific intent. You can just implement all of the protocols in this class and return <code>self</code>, but we’ll put each intent in its own class to keep it better organized.</p>

<p>Because we intend to have a few different classes, let’s give them a common base class for code that we need to share between them:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">class ListOMatIntentsHandler: NSObject {
}
</code></pre>

<p>The intents framework requires us to inherit from <code>NSObject</code>. We’ll fill in some methods later.</p>

<p>We start our search implementation with this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">class SearchItemsIntentHandler: ListOMatIntentsHandler,
                                                       INSearchForNotebookItemsIntentHandling {
}
</code></pre>

<p>To set an intent handler, we need to implement three basic steps</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Resolve</strong> the parameters.<br />
Make sure required parameters are given, and disambiguate any you don’t fully understand.</li>
<li><strong>Confirm</strong> that the request is doable.<br />
This is often optional, but even if you know that each parameter is good, you might still need access to an outside resource or have other requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Handle</strong> the request.<br />
Do the thing that is being requested.</li>
</ol>

<p><code>INSearchForNotebookItemsIntent</code>, the first intent we’ll implement, can be used as a task search. The kinds of requests we can handle with this are, “In List-o-Mat, show the grocery store list” or “In List-o-Mat, show the store list.”</p>

<p>Aside: “List-o-Mat” is actually a bad name for a SiriKit app because Siri has a hard time with hyphens in apps. Luckily, SiriKit allows us to have alternate names and to provide pronunciation. In the app’s <code>Info.plist</code>, add this section:</p>

<figure><figcaption>Add alternate app name's and pronunciation guides to the app plist</figcaption></figure>

<p>This allows the user to say “list oh mat” and for that to be understood as a single word (without hyphens). It doesn’t look ideal on the screen, but without it, Siri sometimes thinks “List” and “Mat” are separate words and gets very confused.</p>

<h4 id="resolve-figuring-out-the-parameters">Resolve: Figuring Out The Parameters</h4>

<p>For a search for notebook items, there are several parameters:</p>

<ol>
<li>the item type (a task, a task list, or a note),</li>
<li>the title of the item,</li>
<li>the content of the item,</li>
<li>the completion status (whether the task is marked done or not),</li>
<li>the location it is associated with,</li>
<li>the date it is associated with.</li>
</ol>

<p>We require only the first two, so we’ll need to write resolve functions for them. <code>INSearchForNotebookItemsIntent</code> has methods for us to implement.</p>

<p>Because we only care about showing task lists, we’ll hardcode that into the resolve for item type. In <code>SearchItemsIntentHandler</code>, add this:</p>

<pre class="break-out"><code class="language-javascript">func resolveItemType(for intent: INSearchForNotebookItemsIntent,
                         with completion: @escaping (INNotebookItemTypeResolutionResult) -> Void) {

    completion(.success(with: .taskList))
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, no matter what the user says, we’ll be searching for task lists. If we wanted to expand our search support, we’d let Siri try to figure this out from the original phrase and then just use <code>completion(.needsValue())</code> if the item type was missing. Alternatively, we could try to guess from the title by seeing what matches it. In this case, we would complete with success when Siri knows what it is, and we would use <code>completion(.notRequired())</code> when we are going to try multiple possibilities.</p>

<p>Title resolution is a little trickier. What we want is for Siri to use a list if it finds one with an exact match for what you said. If it’s unsure or if there is more than one possibility, then we want Siri to ask us for help in figuring it out. To do this, SiriKit provides a set of resolution enums that let us express what we want to happen next.</p>

<p>So, if you say “Grocery Store,” then Siri would have an exact match. But if you say “Store,” then Siri would present a menu of matching lists.</p>

<p>We’ll start with this function to give the basic structure:</p>

<pre class="break-out"><code class="language-javascript">func resolveTitle(for intent: INSearchForNotebookItemsIntent, with completion: @escaping (INSpeakableStringResolutionResult) -> Void) {
    guard let title = intent.title else {
        completion(.needsValue())
        return
    }

    let possibleLists = getPossibleLists(for: title)
    completeResolveListName(with: possibleLists, for: title, with: completion)
}
</code></pre>

<p>We’ll implement <code>getPossibleLists(for:)</code> and <code>completeResolveListName(with:for:with:)</code> in the <code>ListOMatIntentsHandler</code> base class.</p>

<p><code>getPossibleLists(for:)</code> needs to try to fuzzy match the title that Siri passes us with the actual list names.</p>

<pre class="break-out"><code class="language-javascript">public func getPossibleLists(for listName: INSpeakableString) -> [INSpeakableString] {
    var possibleLists = [INSpeakableString]()
    for l in loadLists() {
        if l.name.lowercased() == listName.spokenPhrase.lowercased() {
            return [INSpeakableString(spokenPhrase: l.name)]
        }
        if l.name.lowercased().contains(listName.spokenPhrase.lowercased()) || listName.spokenPhrase.lowercased() == "all" {
            possibleLists.append(INSpeakableString(spokenPhrase: l.name))
        }
    }
    return possibleLists
}
</code></pre>

<p>We loop through all of our lists. If we get an exact match, we’ll return it, and if not, we’ll return an array of possibilities. In this function, we’re simply checking to see whether the word the user said is contained in a list name (so, a pretty simple match). This lets “Grocery” match “Grocery Store.” A more advanced algorithm might try to match based on words that sound the same (for example, with the ),</p>

<p><code>completeResolveListName(with:for:with:)</code> is responsible for deciding what to do with this list of possibilities.</p>

<pre class="break-out"><code class="language-javascript">public func completeResolveListName(with possibleLists: [INSpeakableString], for listName: INSpeakableString, with completion: @escaping (INSpeakableStringResolutionResult) -> Void) {
    switch possibleLists.count {
    case 0:
        completion(.unsupported())
    case 1:
        if possibleLists[0].spokenPhrase.lowercased() == listName.spokenPhrase.lowercased() {
            completion(.success(with: possibleLists[0]))
        } else {
            completion(.confirmationRequired(with: possibleLists[0]))
        }
    default:
        completion(.disambiguation(with: possibleLists))
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If we got an exact match, we tell Siri that we succeeded. If we got one inexact match, we tell Siri to ask the user if we guessed it right.</p>

<p>If we got multiple matches, then we use <code>completion(.disambiguation(with: possibleLists))</code> to tell Siri to show a list and let the user pick one.</p>

<p>Now that we know what the request is, we need to look at the whole thing and make sure we can handle it.</p>

<h4 id="confirm-check-all-of-your-dependencies">Confirm: Check All Of Your Dependencies</h4>

<p>In this case, if we have resolved all of the parameters, we can always handle the request. Typical <code>confirm()</code> implementations might check the availability of external services or check authorization levels.</p>

<p>Because <code>confirm()</code> is optional, we could just do nothing, and Siri would assume we could handle any request with resolved parameters. To be explicit, we could use this:</p>

<pre class="break-out"><code class="language-javascript">func confirm(intent: INSearchForNotebookItemsIntent, completion: @escaping (INSearchForNotebookItemsIntentResponse) -> Void) {
    completion(INSearchForNotebookItemsIntentResponse(code: .success, userActivity: nil))
}
</code></pre>

<p>This means we can handle anything.</p>

<h4 id="handle-do-it">Handle: Do It</h4>

<p>The final step is to handle the request.</p>

<pre class="break-out"><code class="language-javascript">func handle(intent: INSearchForNotebookItemsIntent, completion: @escaping (INSearchForNotebookItemsIntentResponse) -> Void) {
    guard
        let title = intent.title,
        let list = loadLists().filter({ $0.name.lowercased() == title.spokenPhrase.lowercased()}).first
    else {
        completion(INSearchForNotebookItemsIntentResponse(code: .failure, userActivity: nil))
        return
    }

    let response = INSearchForNotebookItemsIntentResponse(code: .success, userActivity: nil)
    response.tasks = list.items.map {
        return INTask(title: INSpeakableString(spokenPhrase: $0.name),
                      status: $0.done ? INTaskStatus.completed : INTaskStatus.notCompleted,
                      taskType: INTaskType.notCompletable,
                      spatialEventTrigger: nil,
                      temporalEventTrigger: nil,
                      createdDateComponents: nil,
                      modifiedDateComponents: nil,
                      identifier: "\(list.name)\t\($0.name)")
    }
    completion(response)
}
</code></pre>

<p>First, we find the list based on the title. At this point, <code>resolveTitle</code> has already made sure that we’ll get an exact match. But if there’s an issue, we can still return a failure.</p>

<p>When we have a failure, we have the option of passing a user activity. If your app uses  and has a way to handle this exact type of request, then Siri might try deferring to your app to try the request there. It will not do this when we are in a voice-only context (for example, you started with “Hey Siri”), and it doesn’t guarantee that it will do it in other cases, so don’t count on it.</p>

<p>This is now ready to test. Choose the intent extension in the target list in Xcode. But before you run it, edit the scheme.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Edit the scheme of the the intent to add a sample phrase for debugging.</figcaption></figure>

<p>That brings up a way to provide a query directly:</p>

<figure class="break-out">)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Notice, I am using “ListOMat” because of the hyphens issue mentioned above. Luckily, it’s pronounced the same as my app’s name, so it should not be much of an issue.</p>

<p>Back in the app, I made a “Grocery Store” list and a “Hardware Store” list. If I ask Siri for the “store” list, it will go through the disambiguation path, which looks like this:</p>

<figure>)</figcaption></figure>

<p>If you say “Grocery Store,” then you’ll get an exact match, which goes right to the results.</p>

<h3 id="adding-items-via-siri">Adding Items Via Siri</h3>

<p>Now that we know the basic concepts of resolve, confirm and handle, we can quickly add an intent to add an item to a list.</p>

<p>First, add <code>INAddTasksIntent</code> to the extension’s plist:</p>

<figure>)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Then, update our <code>IntentHandler</code>’s <code>handle</code> function.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">override func handler(for intent: INIntent) -> Any? {
    switch intent {
    case is INSearchForNotebookItemsIntent:
        return SearchItemsIntentHandler()
    case is INAddTasksIntent:
        return AddItemsIntentHandler()
    default:
        return nil
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Add a stub for the new class:</p>

<pre class="break-out"><code class="language-javascript">class AddItemsIntentHandler: ListOMatIntentsHandler, INAddTasksIntentHandling {
}
</code></pre>

<p>Adding an item needs a similar <code>resolve</code> for searching, except with a target task list instead of a title.</p>

<pre class="break-out"><code class="language-javascript">func resolveTargetTaskList(for intent: INAddTasksIntent, with completion: @escaping (INTaskListResolutionResult) -> Void) {

    guard let title = intent.targetTaskList?.title else {
        completion(.needsValue())
        return
    }

    let possibleLists = getPossibleLists(for: title)
    completeResolveTaskList(with: possibleLists, for: title, with: completion)
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>completeResolveTaskList</code> is just like <code>completeResolveListName</code>, but with slightly different types (a task list instead of the title of a task list).</p>

<pre class="break-out"><code class="language-javascript">public func completeResolveTaskList(with possibleLists: [INSpeakableString], for listName: INSpeakableString, with completion: @escaping (INTaskListResolutionResult) -> Void) {

    let taskLists = possibleLists.map {
        return INTaskList(title: $0, tasks: [], groupName: nil, createdDateComponents: nil, modifiedDateComponents: nil, identifier: nil)
    }

    switch possibleLists.count {
    case 0:
        completion(.unsupported())
    case 1:
        if possibleLists[0].spokenPhrase.lowercased() == listName.spokenPhrase.lowercased() {
            completion(.success(with: taskLists[0]))
        } else {
            completion(.confirmationRequired(with: taskLists[0]))
        }
    default:
        completion(.disambiguation(with: taskLists))
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It has the same disambiguation logic and behaves in exactly the same way. Saying “Store” needs to be disambiguated, and saying “Grocery Store” would be an exact match.</p>

<p>We’ll leave <code>confirm</code> unimplemented and accept the default. For <code>handle</code>, we need to add an item to the list and save it.</p>

<pre class="break-out"><code class="language-javascript">func handle(intent: INAddTasksIntent, completion: @escaping (INAddTasksIntentResponse) -> Void) {
    var lists = loadLists()
    guard
        let taskList = intent.targetTaskList,
        let listIndex = lists.index(where: { $0.name.lowercased() == taskList.title.spokenPhrase.lowercased() }),
        let itemNames = intent.taskTitles, itemNames.count > 0
    else {
            completion(INAddTasksIntentResponse(code: .failure, userActivity: nil))
            return
    }

    // Get the list
    var list = lists[listIndex]

    // Add the items
    var addedTasks = [INTask]()
    for item in itemNames {
        list.addItem(name: item.spokenPhrase, at: list.items.count)
        addedTasks.append(INTask(title: item, status: .notCompleted, taskType: .notCompletable, spatialEventTrigger: nil, temporalEventTrigger: nil, createdDateComponents: nil, modifiedDateComponents: nil, identifier: nil))
    }

    // Save the new list
    lists[listIndex] = list
    save(lists: lists)

    // Respond with the added items
    let response = INAddTasksIntentResponse(code: .success, userActivity: nil)
    response.addedTasks = addedTasks
    completion(response)
}
</code></pre>

<p>We get a list of items and a target list. We look up the list and add the items. We also need to prepare a response for Siri to show with the added items and send it to the completion function.</p>

<p>This function can handle a phrase like, “In ListOMat, add apples to the grocery list.” It can also handle a list of items like, “rice, onions and olives.”</p>

<figure><figcaption>Siri adds a few items to the grocery store list</figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="almost-done-just-a-few-more-settings">Almost Done, Just A Few More Settings</h3>

<p>All of this will work in your simulator or local device, but if you want to submit this, you’ll need to add a <code>NSSiriUsageDescription</code> key to your app’s <code>plist</code>, with a string that describes what you are using Siri for. Something like “Your requests about lists will be sent to Siri” is fine.</p>

<p>You should also add a call to:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">INPreferences.requestSiriAuthorization { (status) in }
</code></pre>

<p>Put this in your main view controller’s <code>viewDidLoad</code> to ask the user for Siri access. This will show the message you configured above and also let the user know that they could be using Siri for this app.</p>

<figure><figcaption>The device will ask for permission if you try to use Siri in the app.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Finally, you’ll need to tell Siri what to tell the user if the user asks what your app can do, by providing some :</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a <code>plist</code> file in your app (not the extension), named <code>AppIntentVocabulary.plist</code>.</li>
<li>Fill out the intents and phrases that you support.</li>
</ol>

<figure class="break-out">)</figcaption></figure>

<p>There is no way to really know all of the phrases that Siri will use for an intent, but Apple does provide a few samples for each intent in its documentation. The  show us that Siri can understand “Show me all my notes on &lt;appName&gt;,” but I found other phrases by trial and error (for example, Siri understands what “lists” are too, not just notes).</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>As you can see, adding Siri support to an app has a lot of steps, with a lot of configuration. But the code needed to handle the requests was fairly simple.</p>

<p>There are a lot of steps, but each one is small, and you might be familiar with a few of them if you have used extensions before.</p>

<p>Here is what you’ll need to prepare for a new extension on Apple’s developer website:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make an app ID for an Intents extension.</li>
<li>Make an app group if you don’t already have one.</li>
<li>Use the app group in the app ID for the app and extension.</li>
<li>Add Siri support to the app’s ID.</li>
<li>Regenerate the profiles and download them.</li>
</ol>

<p>And here are the steps in Xcode for creating Siri’s Intents extension:</p>

<ol>
<li>Add an Intents extension using the Xcode template.</li>
<li>Update the entitlements of the app and extension to match the profiles (groups and Siri support).</li>
<li>Add your intents to the extension’s <code>plist</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>And you’ll need to add code to do the following things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use the app group sandbox to communicate between the app and extension.</li>
<li>Add classes to support each intent with resolve, confirm and handle functions.</li>
<li>Update the generated <code>IntentHandler</code> to use those classes.</li>
<li>Ask for Siri access somewhere in your app.</li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, there are some Siri-specific configuration settings:</p>

<ol>
<li>Add the Siri support security string to your app’s <code>plist</code>.</li>
<li>Add sample phrases to an <code>AppIntentVocabulary.plist</code> file in your app.</li>
<li>Run the intent target to test; edit the scheme to provide the phrase.</li>
</ol>

<p>OK, that is a lot, but if your app fits one of Siri’s domains, then users will expect that they can interact with it via voice. And because the competition for voice assistants is so good, we can only expect that WWDC 2018 will bring a bunch more domains and, hopefully, much better Siri.</p>

<p>(<em>This is a sponsored article</em>.) In my previous article on , I explored the rapidly growing need for UX teams as a result of the emergence of design as a wider business driver. As teams grow, so too does a need for leaders to nurture and guide them.</p>

<p>In my final article in this series on user experience design, I’ll explore the different characteristics of an effective UX leader, and provide some practical advice about growing into a leadership role.</p>

<p>I’ve worked in many organizations &mdash; both large and small, and in both the private and public sectors &mdash; and, from experience, <strong>leadership is a rare quality that is far from commonplace</strong>. Truly inspiring leaders are few and far between; if you’re fortunate to work with one, make every effort to learn from them.</p>

<p>Managers that have risen up the ranks don’t automatically become great leaders, and perhaps one of the biggest lessons I’ve learned is that truly inspirational leaders &mdash; those that inspire passion and commitment &mdash; aren’t as commonplace as you’d think.</p>

<p>A UX leader is truly a hybrid, perhaps more so than in many other &mdash; more traditional &mdash; businesses. A UX leader needs to encompass a wide range of skills:</p>

<ul>
<li>Establishing, driving and articulating a vision;</li>
<li>Communicating across different teams, including design, research, writing, engineering, and business (no small undertaking!);</li>
<li>Acting as a champion for user-focused design;</li>
<li>Mapping design decisions to key performance indicators (KPIs), and vice-versa, so that success can be measured; and</li>
<li>Managing a team, ensuring all the team’s members are challenged and motivated.</li>
</ul>

<p>UX leadership is not unlike being bi-lingual &mdash; or, more accurately, multi-lingual &mdash; and it’s a skill that requires dexterity so that nothing gets lost in translation.</p>

<p>This hybrid skill set can seem daunting, but &mdash; like anything &mdash; <strong>the attributes of leadership can be learned and developed</strong>. In my final article in this series of ten, I’ll explore what defines a leader and focus on the qualities and attributes needed to step up to this important role.</p>


<div class="c-garfield-the-cat">


<h3 id="undertaking-a-skills-audit">Undertaking A Skills Audit</h3>

<p>Every leader is different, and every leader will be informed by the different experiences they have accumulated to date. There are, however, certain qualities and attributes that leaders tend to share in common.</p>

<p><strong>Great leaders demonstrate self-awareness</strong>. They tend to have the maturity to have looked themselves in the mirror and identified aspects of their character that they may need to develop if they are to grow as leaders.</p>

<p>Having identified their strengths and weaknesses and pinpointing areas for improvement, they will have an idea of what they know and — equally important — what they don’t know. As Donald Rumsfeld famously put it:</p>

<blockquote>“There are known knowns: there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns: That is to say, we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns: the things we don't know we don't know.”</blockquote>

<p>Rumsfeld might have been talking about unknown unknowns in a conflict scenario, but his insight applies equally to the world of leadership. To grow as a leader, it’s important to widen your knowledge so that it addresses both:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Known Unknowns</strong><br />
Skills you know that you don’t know, which you can identify through a self-critical skills audit; and</li>
<li><strong>The Unknown Unknowns</strong><br />
Skills you don’t know you don’t know, which you can identify through inviting your peers to review your strengths and weaknesses.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, a skills audit will equip you with a roadmap that you can use as a map to plot a path from where you are now to where you want to be.</p>

<p>To become an effective leader is to embark upon a journey, identifying the gaps in your knowledge and &mdash; step by step &mdash; addressing these gaps so that you’re prepared for the leadership role ahead.</p>

<h4 id="identifying-the-gaps-in-your-knowledge">Identifying The Gaps In Your Knowledge</h4>

<p>One way to identify the gaps in your knowledge is to undertake an honest and self-reflective &lsquo;skills audit&rsquo; while <strong>making an effort to both learn about yourself and learn about the environment</strong> you are working within.</p>

<p>To become a UX leader, it’s critical to develop this self-awareness, identifying the knowledge you need to acquire by undertaking both self-assessments and peer assessments. With your gaps in knowledge identified, it’s possible to build a learning pathway to address these gaps.</p>

<p>In the introduction, I touched on a brief list of skills that an effective and well-equipped leader needs to develop. That list is just the tip of a very large iceberg. At the very least, a hybrid UX leader needs to equip themselves by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Developing an awareness of context, expanding beyond the realms of design to encompass a broader business context;</li>
<li>Understanding and building relationships with a cross-section of team members;</li>
<li>Identifying outcomes and goals, establishing KPIs that will help to deliver these successfully;</li>
<li>Managing budgets, both soft and hard; and</li>
<li>Planning and mapping time, often across a diversified team.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are just a handful of <strong>skills that an effective UX leader needs to develop</strong>. If you&rsquo;re anything like me, hardly any of this was taught at art school, so you’ll need to learn these skills yourself<strong>.</strong> This article will help to point you in the right direction. I’ve also provided a list of required reading for reference to ensure you’re well covered.</p>

<h4 id="a-360º-assessment">A 360º Assessment</h4>

<p>A 360º degree leadership assessment is a form of . Drawn from the world of business, but equally applicable to the world of user experience, it is an excellent way to measure your effectiveness and influence as a leader.</p>

<p>Unlike a top-down appraisal, where a leader or manager appraises an employee underneath them in the hierarchy, a 360º assessment involves inviting your colleagues &mdash; at your peer level &mdash; to appraise you, highlighting your strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<p>This isn’t easy &mdash; and can lead to some uncomfortable home truths &mdash; but it can prove a critical tool in helping you to identify the qualities you need to work on. You might, for example, consider yourself an excellent listener only to discover that your colleagues feel like this is something you need to work on.</p>

<p>This willingness to put yourself under the spotlight, identify your weaknesses, address these, and develop yourself is one of the defining characteristics of leaders. <strong>Great leaders are always learning</strong> and they aren’t afraid to admit that fact.</p>

<p>A 360º assessment is a great way to uncover your ‘unknown unknowns’, i.e. the gaps in your knowledge that you aren’t aware of. With these discoveries in hand, it’s possible to build ‘a learning road-map’ that will allow you to develop the skills you need.</p>

<h4 id="build-a-roadmap">Build A Roadmap</h4>

<p>With the gaps in your knowledge identified, it’s important to adopt some strategies to address these gaps. Great leaders understand that learning is a lifelong process and to transition into a leadership role will require — inevitably — the acquisition of new skills.</p>

<p>To develop as a leader, it’s important to address your knowledge gaps in a considered and systematic manner. By working back from your skills audit, <strong>identify what you need to work on</strong> and build a learning programme accordingly.</p>

<p>This will inevitably involve developing an understanding of different domains of knowledge, but that’s the leader’s path. The important thing is to take it step by step and, of course, to take that first step.</p>

<p>We are fortunate now to be working in an age in which we have an abundance of learning materials at our fingertips. We no longer need to enroll in a course at a university to learn; we can put together our own bespoke learning programmes.</p>

<p>We now have so many tools we can use, from paid resources like  which offers the ability to “learn new skills, pursue your interests and advance your career.”</p>

<p>In short, <strong>you have everything you need to enhance your career</strong> just a click away.</p>

<h3 id="it-s-not-just-you">It’s Not Just You</h3>

<p>Great leaders understand that it’s not about the effort of individuals, working alone. It’s about the effort of individuals — working collectively. Looking back through the history of innovation, we can see that most (if not all) of the greatest breakthroughs were driven by teams that were motivated by inspirational leaders.</p>

<p>Thomas Edison didn’t invent the lightbulb alone; he had an ‘ was similarly conceived.</p>

<p>Great leaders understand that it’s not about them as individuals, but <strong>it’s about the teams they put together</strong>, which they motivate and orchestrate. They have the humility to build and lead teams that deliver towards the greater good.</p>

<p>This &mdash; above all &mdash; is one of the defining characteristics of a great leader: they prioritize and celebrate the team’s success over and above their own success.</p>

<h4 id="it-s-all-about-teamwork">It’s All About Teamwork</h4>

<p>Truly great leaders understand the importance that teams play in delivering outcomes and goals. One of the most important roles a leader needs to undertake is to act as a lynchpin that sits at the heart of a team, identifying new and existing team members, nurturing them, and <strong>building them into a team that works effectively together</strong>.</p>

<p>A forward-thinking leader won’t just focus on the present, but will proactively develop a vision and long-term goals for future success. To deliver upon this vision of future success will involve both identifying potential new team members, but &mdash; just as importantly &mdash; developing existing team members. This involves opening your eyes to the different aspects of the business environment you occupy, getting to know your team, and identifying team members’ strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<p>As a UX leader, an important role you’ll play is helping others by mentoring and coaching them, ensuring they are equipped with the skills they need to grow. Again, this is where a truly selfless leader will put others first, in the knowledge that <strong>the stronger the team, the stronger the outcomes will be</strong>.</p>

<p>As a UX leader, you’ll also act as a champion for design within the wider business context. You’ll act as a bridge &mdash; and occasionally, a buffer &mdash; between the interface of business requirements and design requirements. Your role will be to champion the power of design and sell its benefits, always singing your team’s praises and &mdash; occasionally &mdash; fighting on their behalf (often without their awareness).</p>

<h4 id="the-art-of-delegation">The Art Of Delegation</h4>

<p>It’s possible to build a great UX team from the inside by developing existing team members, and an effective leader will use delegation as an effective development tool to enhance their team members’ capabilities.</p>

<p>Delegation isn&rsquo;t just passing off the tasks you don&rsquo;t want to do, it&rsquo;s about <strong>empowering the different individuals in a team</strong>. A true leader understands this and spends the time required to learn how to delegate effectively.</p>

<p>Delegation is about education and expanding others’ skill sets, and it’s a powerful tool when used correctly. Effective delegation is a skill, one that you’ll need to acquire to step up into a UX leadership role.</p>

<p>When delegating a task to a team member, it’s important to explain to them why you’re delegating the task. As a leader, your role is to <strong>provide clear guidance</strong> and this involves explaining why you’ve chosen a team member for a task and how they will be supported, developed and rewarded for taking the task on.</p>

<p>This latter point is critical: All too often managers who lack leadership skills use delegation as a means to offload tasks and responsibility, unaware of the power of delegation. This is poor delegation and it’s ineffective leadership, though I imagine, sadly, we have all experienced it! An effective leader understands and strives to delegate effectively by:</p>

<ul>
<li>defining the task, establishing the outcomes and goals;</li>
<li>identifying the appropriate individual or team to take the task on;</li>
<li>assessing the team member(s) ability and ascertaining any training needs;</li>
<li>explaining their reasoning, clearly outlining why they chose the individual or team;</li>
<li>stating the required results;</li>
<li>agreeing on realistic deadlines; and</li>
<li>providing feedback on completion of the task.</li>
</ul>

<p>When outlined like this, it becomes clear that <strong>effective delegation is more than simply passing on a task you’re unwilling to undertake</strong>. Instead, it’s a powerful tool that an effective UX leader uses to enable their team members to take ownership of opportunities, whilst growing their skills and experience.</p>

<h4 id="give-success-and-accept-failure">Give Success And Accept Failure</h4>

<p>A great leader is selfless: they give credit for any successes to the team; and accept the responsibility for any failures alone.</p>

<p>A true leader gives success to the team, ensuring that &mdash; when there&rsquo;s a win &mdash; the team is celebrated for its success. A true leader takes pleasure in celebrating the team&rsquo;s win. When it comes to failure, however, a true leader steps up and takes responsibility. A mark of a truly great leader is this selflessness.</p>

<p>As a leader, <strong>you set the direction and nurture the team</strong>, so it stands to reason that, if things go wrong &mdash; which they often do &mdash; you’re willing to shoulder the responsibility. This understanding &mdash; that you need to give success and accept failure &mdash; is what separates great leaders from mediocre managers.</p>

<p>Poor managers will seek to ‘deflect the blame,’ looking for anyone but themselves to apportion responsibility to. Inspiring leaders are aware that, at the end of the day, they are responsible for the decisions made and outcomes reached; when things go wrong they accept responsibility.</p>

<p>If you’re to truly inspire others and lead them to achieve great things, it’s important to remember this distinction between managers and leaders. By giving success and accepting failure, you’ll breed intense loyalty in your team.</p>

<h3 id="lead-by-example">Lead By Example</h3>

<p>Great leaders understand the importance of leading by example, acting as a beacon for others. To truly inspire a team, it helps to connect yourself with that team, and not isolate yourself. Rolling up your sleeves and pitching in, especially when deadlines are pressing, is a great way to demonstrate that you haven’t lost touch with the ‘front line.’</p>

<p>A great leader understands that success is &mdash; always &mdash; a team effort and that a motivated team will deliver far more than the sum of its parts.</p>

<p>As I’ve noted in my previous articles: If you&rsquo;re ever the smartest person in a room, find another room. An effective leader has the confidence to surround themselves with other, smarter people.</p>

<p>Leadership isn&rsquo;t about individual status or being seen to be the most talented. It&rsquo;s about teamwork and getting the most out of a well-oiled machine of individuals working effectively together.</p>

<h4 id="get-out-of-your-silo">Get Out Of Your Silo</h4>

<p>To lead effectively, it’s important to get out of your silo and to see the world as others do. This means getting to know all of the team, throughout the organization and at every level.</p>

<p>Leaders that isolate themselves &mdash; in their often luxurious corner offices &mdash; are, in my experience, poor leaders (if, indeed, they can be called leaders at all!). By distancing themselves from the individuals that make up an organization they run the very real risk of losing touch.</p>

<p>To lead, get out of your silo and acquaint yourself with the totality of your team and, if you’re considering a move into leadership, make it your primary task to explore all the facets of the business.</p>

<h4 id="the-pieces-of-the-jigsaw">The Pieces Of The Jigsaw</h4>

<p>To lead effectively, you need to have an understanding of others and their different skills. In my last article, , I wrote about the idea of ‘T-shaped’ people &mdash; those that have a depth of skill in their field, along with the willingness and ability to collaborate across disciplines. Great leaders tend to be T-shaped, flourishing by seeing things from others’ perspectives.</p>

<p>Every organization &mdash; no matter how large or small &mdash; is like an elaborate jigsaw that is made up of many different interlocking parts. An effective leader is informed by an understanding of this context, they will have made the effort to see all of the pieces of the jigsaw. As a UX leader, you’ll need to <strong>familiarize yourself with a wide range of different teams</strong>, including design, research, writing, engineering, and business.</p>

<p>To lead effectively, it’s important to push outside of your comfort zone and learn about these different specialisms. Do so and you will ensure that you can communicate to these different stakeholders. At the risk of mixing metaphors, you will be the glue that holds the jigsaw together.</p>

<h4 id="sweat-the-details">Sweat The Details</h4>

<p>As Charles and Ray Eames put it:</p>

<blockquote>“The details aren’t the details, they make the product.”</blockquote>

<p>Great leaders understand this: they set the bar high and they encourage and motivate the teams they lead to deliver on the details. To lead a team, it’s important to <strong>appreciate the need to strive for excellence</strong>. Great leaders aren’t happy to accept the status quo, especially if the status quo can be improved upon.</p>

<p>Of course, these qualities can be learned, but many of us &mdash; thankfully &mdash; have them, innately. Few (if any) of us are happy with second best and, in a field driven by a desire to create delightful and memorable user experiences, we appreciate the importance of details and their place in the grand scheme of things. This is a great foundation on which to build leadership skills.</p>

<p>To thrive as a leader, it’s important to share this focus on the details with others, ensuring they understand and appreciate the role that the details play in the whole. Act as a beacon of excellence: <strong>lead by example</strong>; never settle for second best; give success and accept failure&hellip; and your team will follow you.</p>

<h3 id="in-closing">In Closing</h3>

<p>As user experience design matures as a discipline, and the number of different specializations multiplies, so too does the discipline’s need for leaders, to nurture and grow teams. As a relatively new field of expertise, the opportunities to develop as a UX leader are tremendous.</p>

<p>Leadership is a skill and &mdash; like any skill &mdash; it can be learned. As I&rsquo;ve noted throughout this series of articles, one of the best places to learn is to look to other disciplines for guidance, widening the frame of reference. When we consider leadership, this is certainly true.</p>

<p>There is a great deal we can learn from the world of business, and websites like  &mdash; amongst many, many others &mdash; offer us a wealth of insight.</p>

<p>There’s never been a more exciting time to work in User Experience design. UX has the potential to impact on so many facets of life, and the world is crying out for leaders to step up and lead the charge. I’d encourage anyone eager to learn and to grow to undertake a skills audit, take the first step, and embark on the journey into leadership. Leadership is a privilege, rich with rewards, and is something I’d strongly encourage exploring.</p>

<h4 id="suggested-reading">Suggested Reading</h4>

<p>There are many great publications, offline and online, that will help you on your adventure. I’ve included a few below to start you on your journey.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Harvard Business Review website is an excellent starting point and its guide, , provides an excellent overview on developing leadership qualities.</li>
<li>Peter Drucker’s writing on leadership is also well worth reading. Drucker has written many books, one I would strongly recommend is . It’s a short (but very powerful) read, and I read it at least two or three times a year.</li>
<li>If you’re serious about enhancing your leadership credentials, Michael D. Watkins’s , provides a comprehensive insight into transitioning into leadership roles.</li>
<li>Finally, HBR’s website &mdash; mentioned above &mdash; is definitely worth bookmarking. Its business-focused flavor offers designers a different perspective on leadership, which is well worth becoming acquainted with.</li>
