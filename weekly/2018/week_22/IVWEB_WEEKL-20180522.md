                <p>There has been a surge of conversations about the tech industry lacking diversity. Companies are therefore encountering barriers in innovation. The current state of technology faces inequality and privilege, a consequence of having limited voices represented in the design and product development process. In addition, we live in a challenged political and socio-economic state where it’s easier to be divided than come together despite differences.</p>

<p>Design’s role in companies is becoming less about visual appeal and more about hitting business goals and creating value for users. Therefore, the need to build teams with diverse perspectives is becoming imperative. Design will not only be critical to solving problems on the product and experience level, but also relevant on a bigger scale to close social divides and to create inclusive communities.</a></p></blockquote>

<h4>Working Together</h4>
<p>Creating a team who can work well together across different disciplines can be hard. Rachel Andrew solicits some suggestions from the speakers at our upcoming SmashingConf in Toronto. </p>
</div>

<h3>What Is Diversity And Why Is It Important?</h3>

<p>Diversity is in perspectives and values, which are influenced by both inherit traits (such as ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation) as well as acquired traits that are gained from various life experiences (cultural influences, education, social circle, etc.). A combination of traits shape people’s identity and the way they think.</p>

<p>In particular, conflicts and adversities experienced by people have a significant influence on how they develop their values. The more an individual has stepped outside their comfort zone, the more unique of a perspective they bring to the table and an expanded capacity to be compassionate towards others.</p>

<p>Diversity is important because it directly affects long-term success, innovation, and growth. Advantages of working on a diverse team include increased collaboration, effective communication, well-rounded sets of skills represented, less susception to complacency, and active efforts for inclusivity are made earlier in the process.</p>

<h3>What Is The Competing Values Framework?</h3>

<p>The positive correlation between diversity and innovation are undeniable. So how exactly does it work? Having differing and oftentimes clashing perspectives on a team seems to hinder progress rather than drive it. But with the right balance of values, this dynamic is extremely advantageous. Design, as a problem-solving discipline, uses insights to drive innovation, which can only manifest between differences, not commonalities. When different perspectives and values are represented, blind spots become more apparent and implicit biases are challenged.</p>

<p>This is illustrated in the Competing Values Framework, a robust blueprint that was devised by Quinn and Rohrbaugh, based on researching qualities of companies that have sustainably produced a steady stream of innovative solutions over the years. This model for organizational effectiveness shows how different perspectives translate into business values, as well as show where their weaknesses are.</p>

<p>These are categorized into “quadrants” as follows:</p>

<h4>1. Collaborate</h4>

<p>People with characteristics from the Collaborate quadrant are committed to cooperating together based on shared values. They foster trust with each other and with their audience through compassion and empathy. Their priorities are long-term growth of communities and commit to learning and mentoring. While a sense of unity might help a team be more purpose-driven, this can discourage individuals who think differently to bring new ideas to the table because they are averse to taking risks. People here also lose sight of the realities of constraints because they look too far ahead.</p>

<h4>2. Create</h4>

<p>While most people are hesitant to change and innovation, those in this quadrant embrace it. They’re extremely flexible with a shifting landscape of user and business goals and aren’t afraid of taking risks. Creatives see risk as an opportunity for growth and embrace different ways of thinking to come up with solutions. Trends are set by creatives, not followed. In contrast, however, those in this quadrant aren’t as logical and practical with the execution needed to bring ideas to life. Their flexibility can become chaotic and unpredictable. Taking risks can pay off significantly but it’s more detrimental without a foundation.</p>

<h4>3. Compete</h4>

<p>As the name implies, people here are competitive and focus on high performance and big results. They’re excellent decision makers, which is why they get things done quickly. They know exactly how to utilize resources around them to beat competitors and get to the top of the market. Competitors stay focused on the business objectives of increasing revenue and hitting target metrics. On the other hand, they’re not as broad of a visionary in the long run. Since they prioritize immediate results. Because of this, they may not be as compassionate towards their audience and not consider the human side of company growth.</p>

<h4>4. Control</h4>

<p>People in this quadrant focus on creating systems that are reliable and efficient. They’re practical and can plan strategically for scaling, and they constantly revisit their design processes to optimize for productivity. They are extremely detail oriented and can identify areas of opportunities in the unexpected. They’re also experts at dealing with multiple moving parts and turn chaos into harmony. But if there are too many Control qualities on a team, they become vulnerable to falling into complacency since they depend on reliable systems. They are averse to taking risks and fear the nature of unpredictability.</p>


  <div id="sponsors-article" data-impression="true" class="c-promo-box c-promo-box--ad sponsors hidden" data-audience="non-subscriber" data-remove="true"></div>



<p>People and their values don’t always neatly fit into categories but this framework is flexible in helping teams identify their strengths and weaknesses. Many individuals have traits that cover more than one quadrant but there are definitely dominant qualities. Being able to identify what they are on an individual level, as well as within a team and at the company level is important.</p>

<h3>How Do We Use The CVF To Build Diverse Teams?</h3>

<p>There are already many great design processes and frameworks that takes aspects of the CVF to help teams take advantage of diverse perspectives. The sprint model, developed by the design partners at Google Ventures, is an excellent workflow that brings together differing values and skill sets to solve problems, with an emphasis on completing it in a short amount of time. IDEO’s design thinking process, also referred to human-centered design, puts users at the forefront and drive decisions with empathy with collaboration being at the core.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>Learn more about .</em></p>

<p>The CVF complements many existing design processes to help teams bring their differing perspectives together and design more holistically. In order to do this, teams need to evaluate where they are, how to fit in the company and how well that aligns with their priorities. They should also identify the missing voices and assess areas for improvement. They need to be asking themselves,</p>

<blockquote>What has the team dynamic been like for the past year? What progress has been made? What goals (business/user/team) are the most important?</blockquote>

<p>The  is a practical way to (1) establish the desired organizational outcomes and goals, (2) evaluate the current practices of teams within the organization/company and how they manage workflows, and (3) the individual’s role and how they fit into the context of the team and company.</p>

<p>For example, a team that may not have had many roadblocks and disagreements may represent too much of the <strong>Collaborate</strong> quadrant and need people who represent more of the <strong>Compete</strong> quadrant to drive results. A team that has taken risks has had failures, and has dealt with many moving parts (<strong>Create</strong>) may need people who have characteristics of the <strong>Control</strong> quadrant for stability and scaling on a practical level to drive results and growth.</p>

<p>If teams can expand by hiring more, they should absolutely onboard more innovators who bring different perspectives and strengths. But teams should also keep in mind that it’s absolutely possible to work with what they already have and can utilize resources at their disposal. Here are some practical ways that teams can increase diversity:</p>

<h4>Hire For Diversity</h4>

<p>When hiring, it’s important to find people with unique perspectives to complement existing designers and stakeholders. Writing inclusive job descriptions to attract a wider range of candidates makes a big difference. Involving people from all levels and backgrounds within the company who are willing to embrace new perspectives is essential. Hiring managers should ask thoughtful questions to gage how well candidates exercise their problem-solving skills and empathy in real-life business cases. Not making assumptions about others, even with something simple like their pronouns, can establish safe work environments and encourage people to be open about their views and values.</p>

<h4>Step Outside The Bubble</h4>

<p>Whether this would be directly for client work or for building team rapport, it’s valuable to get people out of the office to experience things outside of their familiar scope. It’s worthwhile for design teams to interact with users and spend time in their shoes, not only for their own work as UX practitioners but also to help expand their worldview. They should be encouraged to constantly learn something new. They should be given opportunities to travel to places that are completely different from their comfort zone. Teams should also be encouraged go to design events and learn from industry experts who do similar work but in different contexts. Great ideas emerge when people experience things outside their routine and therefore, should always get out and learn!</p>

<h4>Drive Diversity Initiatives Internally</h4>

<p>Hosting in-house hackathons to get teams to interact differently allows designers to expand their skills while learning new approaches to problem solving. It is also an opportunity to work with people from other teams and acquire the skills to adapt quickly. Bringing in outside experts to share their wisdom is a great way for teams to learn new ways of thinking. Some companies, especially larger organizations, have communities based on interests outside of work such as the love for food or interest in outdoors activities. Teaching each other skills through internal workshops is also great.</p>

<h4>Foster A Culture Of Appreciation</h4>

<p>Some companies have weekly roundtable session where each person on the team shares one thing he or she is appreciative about another person. Not only does this encourage high morale but also empowers teams to produce better work. At the same time, teams are given a safe space to be vulnerable with each other and take risks. This is an excellent way to bond over goals and get teams with differing perspectives together to collaborate.</p>

<h3>What Should Diverse Teams Keep In Mind?</h3>

<p>Acknowledging that while different ideas and values are important, they can clash if conversations are not managed effectively. Discrimination and segregation can happen. But creating a workspace and team dynamic that is open to discussion and a safe space to challenge existing ideas is crucial. People should be open to being challenged and ask questions, rather than get defensive about their ideas. Compromise will be necessary in this process.</p>

<p>When diversity isn’t managed actively, or there is an imbalance of values on a team, several challenges arise:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Communication barriers</em> &mdash; How people say things can be different from how others hear and understand them. Misunderstandings could lead to crucial voices not always being heard. If a particular style of communication is accepted over others, people fear speaking up. They might hold the wisdom to make design decisions that could impact the business. If a culture of openness doesn’t exist, a lot of those gold mines never get their opportunities to see the light of day.</li>
<li><em>Discrimination and segregation</em> &mdash; As teams become more diverse, people can stray away from or avoid others who think differently. This can lead to increased feelings of resentment, leading to segregation and even discrimination. People might be quick to judge one another based on stereotypical references, rather than mustering the courage to understand where they come from.</li>
<li><em>Competition over collaboration</em> &mdash; People on design teams need to work collaboratively but when different perspectives clash and aren’t encouraged to use their perspectives to create value for the company, they become competitive against each other rather than have the willingness to work together. It’s important to bring the team back to the main goal.</li>
</ul>

<p>Embracing different perspectives takes courage but it’s everyone’s responsibility to be mindful of one another. Being surrounded by people with different perspectives is certainly uncomfortable and can be a stretch outside their comfort zones. Design teams are positioned advantageously to do so and be role models to others on its impact. Conversations about leveraging differing perspectives should happen as early in the process as possible to limit friction and encourage effective collaboration.</p>

<h3>Conclusion And Next Steps</h3>

<p>Rather than approach it as an obligation and something with a lot of risk, leaders should see it as a benefit to their company and team’s growth. It is often said that roadblocks are a sign of innovation. Therefore, when designers in a team are faced with challenges, they are able to innovate. And only through the existence different perspectives can such challenges emerge. Assessing where the company, teams, and individuals are within the CVF quadrants is a great start and taking steps to building a team with complementing perspectives will be key to driving long-term innovation.</p>

<p><strong>Introducing Git protocol version 2</strong><br />
https://opensource.googleblog.com/2018/05/introducing-git-protocol-version-2.html<br />
Git protocol version 2, a major update of Git’s wire protocol (how clones, fetches and pushes are communicated between clients and servers). This update removes one of the most inefficient parts of the Git protocol and fixes an extensibility bottleneck, unblocking the path to more wire protocol improvements in the future. The protocol version 2 spec can be found  . The main improvements are: Server-side filtering of references; Easy extensibility for new features like ref-in-want and fetching and pushing symrefs Simplified client handling of the http transport.</p>

<p><strong>What if JavaScript wins?</strong><br />
https://medium.com/@anildash/what-if-javascript-wins-84898e5341a<br />
JavaScript is now part of the toolkit of most working developers. What if network effects push it into being the first-ever truly dominant programming language?</p>

<p><strong>Web performance made easy</strong><br />
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv-l3-tJgGk<br />
The web has made great progress in enabling fast experiences, but building a fast site today isn’t trivial. At Google, we analyze a lot of sites and have learned what makes them load quickly and run smoothly. In this talk, Ewa Gasperowicz and Addy Osmani show you how to find and fix the most common web performance bottlenecks to improve your UX by using tools like Lighthouse and DevTools, and discover the latest browser APIs (e.g. Service Workers, Async Images, Fetch Priorities) to get more control over your loading experience. 另附：.</p>

<p><strong>First Look: Angular Ivy - Angular’s new rendering pipeline and view engine</strong><br />
https://www.telerik.com/blogs/first-look-angular-ivy<br />
We’re going to take a look at what Ivy is, how it works, and how you can stay up to date on its progress. Just a caveat: Ivy is still in early stages of being actively developed, so this article is subject to change. Okay, let’s get to it!</p>

<p><strong>Modern Web Stack—Rails 5 API + ActiveAdmin + Create React App on Heroku</strong><br />
https://blog.heroku.com/a-rock-solid-modern-web-stack<br />
Rails is an incredible framework, but modern web development has moved to the front-end, meaning sometimes you don’t need all the bulk of the asset pipeline and the templating system. In Rails 5 you can now create an API-only Rails app, meaning you can build your front-end however you like—using Create React App. 另附：</p>

<p><strong>Debugging Modern Web Applications</strong><br />
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/05/debugging-modern-web-applications/<br />
Building and debugging modern JavaScript applications in Firefox DevTools just took a quantum leap forward. In collaboration with Logan Smyth, Tech Lead for Babel, we leveled up the debugger’s source map support to let you inspect the code that you actually wrote. Combined with the ongoing initiative to offer first-class JS framework support across all our devtools, this will boost productivity for modern web app developers. 另附：.</p>

<p><strong>Page Transitions for Everyone</strong><br />
https://css-tricks.com/page-transitions-for-everyone/<br />
Animation matters. It can be used to improve the user experience. On the web, most of the effort used to improve the experience is in structure, visual design, or even the performance of the site. There are some elements you can swipe around here and there, but that’s about it. A boring remnant of the time when the web was simply used to navigate through a bunch of text pages later upgraded with some sliding text.</p>

<p><strong>A Strategy Guide To CSS Custom Properties</strong><br />
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/05/css-custom-properties-strategy-guide/<br />
Custom properties have a huge potential to change how we write and structure CSS and to a lesser extent, how we use JavaScript to interact with UI components. I’m not going to focus on the syntax and how they work (for that I recommend you read “It’s Time To Start Using Custom Properties”). Instead, I want to take a deeper look at strategies for getting the most out of CSS Custom Properties.</p>

<p><strong>Clean Node</strong><br />
https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/clean-node-1df635d176f7<br />
This article is first of a three-part series discussing this exact topic and suggesting potential solutions. Each article will use a test-first approach, either unit or end-to-end: This first article will set a common ground: quick and dirty version with end to end tests and discussing common mistakes, general opinions and misconceptions; The second article will refactor the “quick and dirty” version with unit tests and a layered architecture; The fourth article will refactor the code using the Clean Architecture and unit tests.</p>

<p><strong>The http headers we don’t want</strong><br />

<p><strong>Performance Impact of Removing OOBGC</strong><br />
https://githubengineering.com/removing-oobgc/<br />
GitHub used an Out of Band Garbage Collector (OOBGC) in production. Since removing it, we decreased CPU time across our production machines by 10%. Let’s talk about what an OOBGC is, when to use it, and when not to use it. Then follow up with some statistics about the impact of removing it from GitHub’s stack.</p>

<p><strong>Full Cycle Developers at Netflix — Operate What You Build</strong><br />
https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/full-cycle-developers-at-netflix-a08c31f83249<br />
Fast forward to 2018. Netflix has grown to 125M global members enjoying 140M+ hours of viewing per day. We’ve invested significantly in improving the development and operations story for our engineering teams. Along the way we’ve experimented with many approaches to building and operating our services. We’d like to share one approach, including its pros and cons, that is relatively common within Netflix. We hope that sharing our experiences inspires others to debate the alternatives and learn from our journey.</p>

<p><strong>AI and Compute</strong><br />
https://blog.openai.com/ai-and-compute/?<br />
Three factors drive the advance of AI: algorithmic innovation, data (which can be either supervised data or interactive environments), and the amount of compute available for training. Algorithmic innovation and data are difficult to track, but compute is unusually quantifiable, providing an opportunity to measure one input to AI progress.</p>

https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3220266<br />
This article takes a closer look at two storage system design approaches used in a majority of modern databases—read-optimized B-trees1 and write-optimized LSM (log-structured merge)-trees5—and describes their use cases and tradeoffs.</p>

<p><strong>Big Data File Formats Demystified</strong><br />
https://www.datanami.com/2018/05/16/big-data-file-formats-demystified/<br />
The big data community has basically settled on three optimized file formats for use in Hadoop clusters: Optimized Row Columnar (ORC), Avro, and Parquet. While these file formats share some similarities, each of them are unique and bring their own relative advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<p><strong>Dynamic Programming – 7 Steps to Solve any DP Interview Problem</strong><br />
http://www.novaspivack.com/science/we-have-discovered-a-new-pattern-in-the-prime-numbers-parallax-compression<br />
Many tech companies like to ask DP questions in their interviews. While we can debate whether they’re effective in evaluating someone’s ability to perform in an engineering role, DP continues to be an area that engineers trip on their way to finding a job that they love.</p>

<p><strong>Docker is the dangerous gamble which we will regret</strong><br />
http://www.smashcompany.com/technology/docker-is-a-dangerous-gamble-which-we-will-regret<br />
Every time I criticize Docker I get angry responses. When I wrote Why would anyone choose Docker over fat binaries? 6 months ago I saw some very intelligent responses on Hacker News, but also some angry ones. So in writing this current essay, I am trying to answer some of the criticism I expect to get in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Tarballs, the ultimate container image format</strong><br />
https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/blog/2018/tarballs-the-ultimate-container-image-format/<br />
On your Guix machine, you run: <code class="highlighter-rouge">guix pack -S /opt/gnu/bin=bin guile gnutls guile-json</code> , and you get a tarball containing your favorite programming language implementation and a couple of libraries, where /opt/gnu/bin is a symlink to the bin directory containing, in this case, the guile command. Add -f docker and, instead of a tarball, you get an image in the Docker format that you can pass to docker load on any machine where Docker is installed. Overall that’s a relatively easy way to share software stacks with machines that do not run Guix.</p>

<p><strong>We Are Designers By Nature</strong><br />
http://moha.studio/labs/introduction-to-design-we-are-designers-by-natural.html<br />
Our planet natural is rich with millions of samples of design, if you break it down into smaller components you will figure out more an of micro-designs. For me, that’s why I fall in love with the design, it’s the way of universe creation. Design principles are many, for example, Golden ratio. you can view the next video to learn more about golden ratio implementation in the universe around you.</p>

<p><strong>Landing The Concept: Movie High-Concept Theory And UX Design</strong><br />
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/05/high-concept-theory-ux-design/<br />
Steven Spielberg once famously said, “If a person can tell me the idea in 25 words or less, it’s going to make a pretty good movie.”  What if the same were true for websites? Do sites that explain their ‘concept’ in a simple way have a better shot at mass-appeal with users? If we look at the super simple layout of Google’s homepage, for example, it gives users a single clear message about its concept equally as well as the Jaws movie poster: Being aware of the importance of ‘high-concept’ allows us — as designers — to really focus on user’s initial impressions.</p>

<p><strong>Apple News — a usability case study</strong><br />
https://uxdesign.cc/apple-news-a-usability-case-study-1ae7b037a7fd<br />
As a frequent user of the Apple News app, I liked it for a whole year. It wasn’t amazing, but it got the job done, and I was too lazy to download a new app. But then suddenly, two months ago, it just became too much. Waking up every day and seeing those sad and negative headlines, it wasn’t the best way to start the day. Then, I decided not to check the news in the morning and do it around noon, but sometimes it would just ruin my lunch. Later, I changed it for the nighttime, and I couldn’t sleep because I felt like the world was going to end.</p>

<p><strong>Design for Humans Or 14 Principles of Good Design</strong><br />
https://uxplanet.org/design-for-humans-e8fc7924286d<br />

<p><strong>Exploring the Gestalt Principles of Design</strong><br />
https://www.toptal.com/designers/ui/gestalt-principles-of-design<br />
There are six individual principles commonly associated with gestalt theory: similarity, continuation, closure, proximity, figure/ground, and symmetry &amp; order (also called prägnanz). There are also some additional, newer principles sometimes associated with gestalt, such as common fate.</p>

<p><strong>Investigating User Experience with Natural Language Analysis</strong><br />
https://blog.algorithmia.com/investigating-user-experience-with-natural-language-analysis/<br />
User experience and customer support are integral to every company’s success. But it’s not easy to understand what users are thinking or how they are feeling, even when you read every single user message that comes in through feedback forms or customer support software. With Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques it becomes somewhat easier to understand trends in user sentiment, main topics discussed, and detect anomalies in user message data. 另附：</p>

我们一定要有一个坚定不移的深刻的理念，相信整个世界终究是为技术所驱动的；有没有其他人已经解决这个问题？然后你可以把你的时间放在更好的创新上；做什么事情一定要做最好，一定要是做业界最强的；我把自己想象是一个软件、一个代码，今天的版本一定要比昨天版本好，明天的版本肯定会比今天好；看到问题也不要去问别人，就把它Fix。</p>
