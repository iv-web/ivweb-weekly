<h1 id="#title_2" >3、Creating A UX Strategy</h1>
Christopher Murphy
[https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/03/creating-a-ux-strategy/](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/03/creating-a-ux-strategy/)
<p>(<em>This is a sponsored article</em>.) As designers working primarily on screen, we often think of user experience design as being primarily a screen-focused activity. In fact, user experience affects the entirety of what we build and that often includes activities that are undertaken off-screen.</p>

<p>To design truly memorable experiences, we need to widen our frame of reference to include all of the brand touchpoints that our users come into contact with along their customer journey. Doing so has the potential to materially impact upon business outcomes, recognizing the role that design &mdash; and user experience &mdash; can play at the heart of a wider business strategy.</p>

<p>Whether you’re building a website or an application, <strong>at heart you are designing for users</strong> and, as such, it’s important to consider these users at the center of a customer-focused ecosystem. Great brands are more than just logos or marques, and websites or applications, they’re about the totality of the user experience, wherever a customer comes into contact with the brand.</p>

<p>This expanded design focus &mdash; considering touchpoints both on- and off-screen &mdash; becomes particularly important as our role as designers widens out to design the entirety of the experience considering multiple points of contact. It’s not uncommon for the websites and apps we build to be a part of a wider, design-focused ecosystem &mdash; and that’s where UX strategy comes in.</p>





<div class="c-garfield-the-cat">


<p>Over the last few years, we have seen designers move up the chain of command and, thankfully, we are starting to see designers occupy senior roles within organizations. The emergence of designers as part of the C-Suite in companies is a welcome development and, with it, we are seeing the emergence of CDOs, Chief Design Officers.</p>

<p>As James Pallister put it in "," an article exploring the CDO phenomenon written for the UK’s Design Council:</p>

<blockquote>"As Apple’s valuation shot higher and higher in recent years, a flurry of major corporations &mdash; Philips, PepsiCo, Hyundai &mdahs; announced the appointments of Chief Design Officers to their boards.<br /><br />This was no mere coincidence. Seeking to emulate the stellar success of design-led businesses like Apple, global companies are pouring investment into design."</blockquote>

<p>This investment in, and appreciation of, design has been long overdue and is beginning to impact upon our day-to-day role as designers.</p>

<p>Forward-thinking companies are elevating the role of designers within their hierarchies and, equally importantly, stressing the importance of design thinking as a core, strategic business driver. As a result, we are seeing design driving company-wide business innovation, creating better products and more engaged relationships with customers.</p>

<p>As this trend continues, giving designers a seat at the top table, <strong>it’s important to widen our scope and consider UX strategy in a holistic manner</strong>. In this article, the eighth in my  exploring user experience design, I’ll open the aperture a little to consider how design impacts beyond the world of screens as part of a wider strategy.</p>

<h3>Considering Customer Journeys</h3>

<p>Before users come into contact with a website or an app, they will likely have been in contact with a brand in other ways &mdash; often off-screen. When considering design in the widest sense, it’s important to focus on the entirety of the customer journey, designing every point of contact between a user and a brand.</p>

<p>Forrester, the market research company, defines the customer journey as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The customer journey spans a variety of touchpoints by which the customer moves from awareness to engagement and purchase. Successful brands focus on developing a seamless experience that ensures each touchpoint interconnects and contributes to the overall journey."</blockquote>

<p>This idea &mdash; of a seamless and well-designed experience and a journey through a brand &mdash; should lie at the heart of a considered UX strategy. To design truly memorable experiences, we need to focus not just on websites or apps, but on all of the touchpoints a user might come into contact with.</p>

<p>Consider the Apple Store and its role acting as a beacon for Apple and all of its products. The Apple Store is, of course, an offline destination, but that doesn't mean that the user experience of the store hasn't been designed down to the last detail. The store is just one part of Apple’s wider engagement strategy, driving awareness of the business.</p>

<p>The Apple Store is an entry point into Apple's ecosystem and, as such, it's important that it's considered in a holistic manner: Every aspect of it is designed.</p>

<p>Jesse James Garrett, the founder of Adaptive Path which is an end-to-end experience design company, considers this all-embracing approach in an excellent article, "," identifying a series of lessons we can learn from and apply to our designs. As Garrett notes:</p>

<blockquote>"Apple wants to sell products, but their first priority is to make you want the products. And that desire has to begin with your experience of the products in the store."</blockquote>

<p>Seen through this lens, it becomes clear that <strong>the products we design are often just one aspect of a larger system</strong>, every aspect of which needs to be designed. As our industry has matured, we’ve started to draw lessons from other disciplines, including service design, considering every point as part of a broader service journey, helping us to situate our products within a wider context.</p>

<p>If service design is new to you, Nielsen Norman Group (helpful as ever), have an excellent primer on the discipline named "" which is well worth reading to gain an understanding of how a focus on service design can map over to other disciplines.</p>

<p>When designing a website or an app, it’s important to consider the totality of the customer journey and focus on all of the touchpoints a user will come into contact with</strong>. Do so, and we can deliver better and more memorable user experiences.</p>

<h3>Designing Touchpoints</h3>

<p>As our industry has evolved, we’ve begun to see our products less as standalone experiences, but as part of a wider network of experiences comprised of ‘touchpoints’ &mdash; all of which need to be designed.</p>

<p><strong>Touchpoints are all the points at which a user comes into contact with a brand.</strong> As designers, our role is expanding to encompass a consideration of these touchpoints, as a part of a broader, connected UX strategy.</p>

<p>With the emergence of smartphones, tablets, wearables and connected products our scope has expanded, widening out to consider multiple points at which users come into contact with the brands we are designing.</p>

<p>When considering a UX strategy, it helps to spend some time listing all of the points at which a user will come into contact with the brand. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Websites,</li>
<li>Apps and mobile experiences,</li>
<li>Email,</li>
<li>Support services,</li>
<li>Social media.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to these <em>digital points</em> of contact, it’s important to consider <em>>non-digital points</em> of contact, too. These off-screen points of contact include everything, from how someone answers the phone to the packaging of physical products.</p>

<p>To aid with this, it helps to develop a ‘touchpoints matrix’ &mdash; a visual framework that allows a designer to join the dots of the overall user experience. This matrix helps you to visually map out all of the different devices and contexts in which a user will come into contact with your brand.</p>

<p>The idea of a touchpoints matrix was conceived by Gianluca Brugnoli &mdash; a teacher at Politecnico di Milano and designer at Frog Design &mdash; as a tool that fuses customer journey mapping with system mapping, which can be used as the basis for considering <strong>how different user personas come into contact with and move through a brand</strong>.</p>

<p>Roberta Tassi, as part of her excellent website  Tassi provides a helpful overview, and I’d recommend bookmarking and exploring the website &mdash; it’s a comprehensive resource.</p>

<p>As she summarises:</p>

<blockquote>"The matrix brings a deeper comprehension of interactions and facilitates further development of the opportunities given by the system &mdash; of the possible entry points and paths &mdash; shifting the focus of the design activities to connections."</blockquote>

<p>This shift &mdash; from stand-alone to connected experiences &mdash; is critically important in the development of a ‘joined up’ UX strategy.</p>

<p>When you embark upon developing and mapping a broader UX strategy, a touchpoints matrix helps you to see how the different nodes of a design join up to become part of an integrated and connected experience or an 'ecosystem.'</p>

<h3>Building Ecosystems</h3>

<p>When we holistically consider our role as designers, we can start to explore <strong>the design of the whole experience:</strong> from initial contact with a brand offline, through engaging with that brand digitally. Collectively, these amount to designing a brand ecosystem.</p>

<p>Ecosystems aren't just for big brands &mdash; like Facebook, Instagram or Twitter &mdash; they are increasingly for everything we design. In a world that is ever more connected, what we design doesn’t stand in isolation. As such, <strong>we need to consider both context and scope as part of an integrated strategy.</strong></p>

<p>In addition to considering the design of products, we also need to consider the wider ecosystem that these products sit within. For example, when considering the design of applications &mdash; whether web-based or native &mdash; we also need to consider: the user’s first point of contact and how we drive discovery; the experience while using the application itself; and addressing wider issues (such as offering users support).</p>

<p>All of the aspects of an ecosystem need to be designed so that we deliver great user experiences at every point in the process. This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>The process of discovery, through social and other channels;</li>
<li>The design of a company or application’s website, so that the story that’s told is consistent and engaging;</li>
<li>The content of email campaigns to ensure they’re equally considered, especially if there are multiple email campaigns targeted at different audiences;</li>
<li>The packaging, when we’re designing physical, connected products; and</li>
<li>The support we offer, ensuring that customers are looked after at every point of the journey, especially when issues arise.</li>
</ul>

<p>This list is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg, but it clearly shows that there are multiple points on a customer’s journey that need to be designed. A considered UX strategy helps us to deliver on all of these aspects of an ecosystem and become increasingly important as the ecosystems we design become richer and more complex.</p>

<h3>In Closing</h3>

<p>The opportunities ahead are fantastic for designers working in this industry. The landscape we are designing for is evolving rapidly and, if we're to stay ahead of the game, it's important that we <strong>turn our attention towards the design of systems in addition to products</strong>. This involves an understanding of UX strategy in the broadest sense.</p>

<p>When embarking upon the design of a new website or product, or undertaking a redesign, it’s important to widen the frame of reference. Taking a step back and considering the entirety of the user experience leads to better and more memorable experiences.</p>

<p>By considering the entirety of the customer journey and all the touchpoints along the way we can create more robust, connected experiences. By focusing on the design of holistic experiences, we can delight users, ensuring they’re happy with the entire experience we have crafted.</p>

[https://www.oschina.net/news/94508/huawei-cloud-maven](https://www.oschina.net/news/94508/huawei-cloud-maven)
<p>近期，华为云与 Sonatype 签署了有关 Maven 中央仓的合作协议，华为云将作为中国唯一 Maven 中央仓的官方镜像节点，为国内广大开发者提供便捷的加速服务。</p><p>华为云是领先的云服务提供商，致力于为客户提供稳定可靠、安全可信、可持续演进的云服务。其中，DevCloud 是集华为研发实践、前沿研发理念、先进研发工具为一体的研发云平台，面向开发者提供研发工具服务，让软件开发云简单高效。Sonatype 是 Apache&nbsp;Maven 的核心贡献者，支持全球最大的开源组件（中央仓），为开发者提供全球最受欢迎的资源库管理器（Nexus），帮助加速软件创新。Nexus 累计安装超过 12 万个，帮助开发组织智能地收集，管理，组装和维护开源和第三方组件，从而提高软件供应链的质量，安全性和速度。华为云和 Sonatype 在云战略上是高度匹配的，华为云为 Sonatype 提供安全可靠的云底座，Sonatype 借力华为云的基础设施能力帮助软件行业用户实现云端创新、重塑商业场景，双方各取所长，优势互补。</p><p><img src="https://static.oschina.net/uploads/space/2018/0323/164443_pAbS_2720166.jpeg"/> &nbsp;<br/><strong>生态合作伙伴大会上华为云与 Sonatype 联合发布中国官方 Maven 中央仓</strong></p><p>Maven 是一款软件的工程管理和自动构建工具，基于工程对象模型（POM）的概念，奉行“约定优于配置”原则。包依赖管理是 Maven 的重要特性之一，随着开源运动的发展，几乎所有的软件都不可避免的会使用到第三方开源库，Java 的开源类库非常丰富，我们可以通过依赖方式方便地引入到工程中使用。但是随着依赖增多版本不一致、版本冲突、依赖臃肿等问题都会接踵而来，Maven 通过坐标（GAV）标准化地定义了每一个开源组件和依赖关系，漂亮地解决了这些问题。虽然 Maven 提供了一个免费中央仓，让开发者可以方便地找到全球大部分需要的第三方库。但是国内开发者由于网络原因，直接从海外的 Maven 中央仓下载第三方包速度非常慢或者很不稳定，影极大的影响了软件构建效率。</p><p>目前，华为云与 Sonatype 联合发布的国内唯一官方 Maven 中央仓，将给广大开发者提供镜像加速服务。它主要体现在：</p><ul class=" list-paddingleft-2" style="list-style-type: disc;"><li><p><strong>安全</strong>&nbsp;- 由华为提供企业级的可信代码仓库，避免第三方包来源不明的安全风险</p></li><li><p><strong>完整</strong>&nbsp;- 作为 Maven 的官方镜像节点，所有数据将实时与主节点同步，确保资源完整</p></li><li><p><strong>可靠</strong>&nbsp;- 基于华为云高可靠性的能力，确保代码仓库 7*24 小时都可以访问</p></li><li><p><strong>便捷</strong>&nbsp;- 基于华为云 DevCloud，提供在软件开发过程中一键获取代码仓库的能力</p></li><li><p><strong>效率</strong>&nbsp;- 基于国内网络环境进行 CDN 加速优化，确保开发人员获得更极致的下载体验</p></li></ul><p>Sonatype 国际副总裁邱伟文表示：“我们很高兴能与华为合作，为中国 Maven 中央仓提供可靠，高速，全面的镜像。中央仓是世界上最大的 Java 和其他开源组件集合。在 2017 年，它处理了 870 亿次下载请求，并为访问和分发数百万开发人员的软件组件提供了最简单的方法。有了华为提供的国内镜像，中国的软件开发人员将能够比以往更加自信和快速地提供软件。“</p><p>华为云 DevCloud 首席 CTO 徐峰表示：“其实，国内广大的软件开发者一直都默默地忍受着代码构建下载的痛苦，华为本着解决实际问题的角度出发，为每一次软件构建的背后，都进行着可信加速，国内开发者终于可以向‘构建1小时等待3小时’的时代说再见了”。华为云携手伙伴开放合作，践行‘上不做应用，下不碰数据，不做股权投资’的‘三不’承诺，坚持做伙伴的应用、内容和云生长的‘黑土地&#39;，做智能世界的使能者。</p><p>华为云 Maven 仓库地址：</p>

<h1 id="#title_25" >26、VX-API-Gateway 1.0.0 发布，全异步API网关</h1>

[https://www.oschina.net/news/94498/vx-api-gateway-1-0-released](https://www.oschina.net/news/94498/vx-api-gateway-1-0-released)
<p>
	VX-API-Gateway是基于Vert.x3.5.1(java)开发的API网关,是一个集分布式,全异步,高性能,可扩展 ,轻量级的API网关</p><p>
	网关的执行流程灵感部分参考了阿里云的API网关;</p><p></p><h3>
		软件使用说明	</h3><p></p><h1>
		VX-API 执行流程	</h1><p><br/>绿线代表一定会执行,黑线代表当存在时执行,当用户请求的时候,完整的流程按组件顺序由1开始执行到7,如果不满足任意一个组件时请求结束并响应(fail-end-response),当任意组件出现异常时统一进入异常组件(Exception
 Handler)请求结束并响应错误信息<br/>API的执行流程参考组件介绍	</p><h2>
		组件介绍	</h2><h3>
		1.黑名单检查	</h3><p>
		该组件永远会被执行!
 用户请求时第一步先经过黑名单检查,VX-API会读取请求中的remote 
Address并获取用户的host(也就是获取用户的IP地址),如果用户的IP地址在全局黑名单中,结束请求并响应状态码:404,状态信息:you
 can&#39;t access this service;反则继续执行处理...	</p><h3>
		2.访问限制	</h3><p>
		当创建API时开启了访问限制,该组件会被执行! 访问限制单位分别为:天/小时/分;可以设置API与IP限制,IP的限制不能大于API的限制;<br/>假设开启API限制:1分钟可以访问1000次;如果1分钟内访问次数大于1000将结束请求并响应请求(响应内容为:创建API中定义API返回结果:访问限制返回);反则继续执行处理...	</p><h3>
		3.参数检查	</h3><p>
		当创建API时如果在定义API请求中添加了入参定义,该组件会被执行! 组件会根据入参定义规定的格式检查请求中的参数;<br/>如果参数不符合入参定义结束请求并响应请求(响应内容为:创建API中定义API返回结果:网关入口参数检查失败返回);反则继续执行处理...	</p><h3>
		4.权限认证	</h3><p>
		当创建API时开启了安全认证,该组件会被执行! 组件会将流程交给权限认证插件,权限认证插件负责做相关处理后决定将流程交给下一个组件处理或结束请求	</p><h3>
		5.前置处理器	</h3><p>
		当创建API时开启了前置处理器,该组件会被执行! 组件会将流程交给前置处理器插件,前置处理器插件负责做相关处理后决定将流程交给下一个组件处理或结束请求	</p><h3>
		6.中心处理器(主处理器)	</h3><p>
		当前面的组件都执行通过时,该组件永远会被执行! 组件会根据服务类型做相应的处理,处理完毕后组件会判断是否开启了后置处理器,如果开启了后置处理器,组件会将流程交给后置处理器,并传递一个标识告诉后置处理器当前组件处理的结果;反则结束请求并返回服务结果;	</p><h3>
		7.后置处理器	</h3><p>
		当创建API时开启了后置处理器,该组件会被执行! 该组件是正常流程的最后一个组件,组件会收到主处理器的执行结果,组件做完相应操作后必须做对请求的响应用户的请求;	</p><h3>
		8.异常处理器	</h3><p>
		当以上任意组件在执行的过程中出现了异常,该组件会被执行! 组件会结束请求并响应请求(响应内容为:创建API中定义API返回结果:发生异常/失败返回);	</p><h2>
		服务类型介绍	</h2><p>
		服务类型指网关主处理器要处理的类型,详情参考类型以下的介绍	</p><h3>
		HTTP/HTTPS	</h3><p>
		表示后台服务是常见的HTTP/HTTPS,也就是网关要将用户的请求发送的目的地,该服务支持带权重的负载均衡支持轮询与哈希策略(默认轮询),自动断路并重试连接;当网关请求后台服务地址失败时会提交给策略,如果同一个服务地址失败两次及以上时,会被策略移除,网关会检测策略中是否存在不可用的服务地址,如果存在会根据设定的重试时间进行重试,重试后如果服务地址可用则将服务地址重新添加到策略中	</p><h3>
		页面跳转	</h3><p>
		该服务用于做链接重定向,当用户请求该服务的API时会,网关会返回状态302,告诉浏览器跳转到指定的URL;	</p><h3>
		自定义服务	</h3><p>
		自定义服务其实跟前置处理器实现的功能差不多,因为前置处理器可以做完相应处理后响应用户请求,自定义服务中提供了三个默认的实现,分别为获取网关时间戳,返回常量值与Session认证的授权	</p><h2>

<h1 id="#title_53" >54、The Nomadic Designer: Tips And Tricks To Work On The Road</h1>
Javier Cuello
[https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/03/nomadic-designer-tips-tricks/](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/03/nomadic-designer-tips-tricks/)
<p>Have you ever wondered what it would be like to travel the world while working as a designer? It might sound like a dream, but all that glitters is not gold, and it might not be the right choice for you. In this article, I&rsquo;ll share some insights from my four years of travel and work that hopefully will be useful for anyone willing to try a nomadic lifestyle, too.</p>

<p>When I wrote the first draft of this article, I was in London, after a long trip to Asia. Now, I&rsquo;m making changes to it in Mexico, before going to Argentina to visit my family. Changing countries often has become an important part of my life as a designer; and, curiously, it all happened by accident.</p>

<p>I once heard that, while at the office, you should stand up from your desk, stretch your legs, leave the building and never come back. That&rsquo;s exactly what I did when I was living in Barcelona in March 2014. At the time, I was working for a big company on a project that I didn&rsquo;t enjoy, and was participating in meetings with people I didn&rsquo;t know. Sounds like fun, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>Looking back, I see that quitting a stable job to jump into the void of a traveling life was one of the scariest moments of my life. I was going to start a trip to South America, doing design workshops and lectures that would provide me with income to sustain my journey &mdash; but in reality, I had no idea what I was doing. Without knowing it, I was becoming a nomadic designer.</p>

<p>When that six-month trip ended and I went back to Barcelona, I was never able to settle again. So, what did I do? Of course, I kept traveling! Four years and 60 countries later, I&rsquo;m still on it.</p>

<p>And I am not alone. I&rsquo;d like to quote Vitaly Friedman (founder and long-time :</p>

<blockquote>“There is nothing more liberating and sentimental than the sound of a closing door that you will never open again. As memories are flowing by, you turn your back from that door, you hold your breath for just a second and you walk away. At that point you almost sense the change in the wind flowing by. You let go; and knowing and feeling this change is an incredibly empowering, intoxicating experience.”</blockquote>

<p>If this sounds appealing, and you would like to try it for yourself, I hope my article will help you get started. Please note, however, that I&rsquo;m not going to give you a &ldquo;how to&rdquo; guide, with step-by-step instructions that will work for everyone. Instead, I&rsquo;ll share some insights from my personal experience.</p>

<h3 id="whatever-people-think-it-is-it-is-not-that">Whatever People Think It Is, It Is Not That</h3>

<p>When I tell someone that I&rsquo;m constantly traveling, usually the person looks amazed. Most of the time, their first question is, &ldquo;How can you afford to live like that?&rdquo; I sometimes joke, saying I&rsquo;m a millionaire with plenty of free time, but it&rsquo;s not only because of this that I suspect they get the wrong idea about &ldquo;working and traveling.&rdquo; Perhaps, some of them imagine plenty of beaches and a lot of comfort and freedom.</p>

<p>Well, guess what? Working from a beach is not that fun or convenient. Or, as .&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the part about having a lot of freedom is true. I do have a lot of freedom and flexibility &mdash; like any other freelancer &mdash; with the bonus that I get to know different places, people, cultures and cuisines. The perks of such a lifestyle outweigh the difficulties, but at the same time, not everyone would be willing to handle it.</p>

<p>Today, the &ldquo;digital nomad&rdquo; hype is .</p>

<p>In case you are considering trying something similar, it might help to be aware of some personal characteristics that would be helpful to have.</p>

<h4 id="comfort-with-being-alone">Comfort With Being Alone</h4>

<p>Being a solo traveler allows me to make my own decisions and be wherever I want, whenever I want. I spend a lot of time by myself (luckily, I get along well with myself). Even though it&rsquo;s fine for me, I know it&rsquo;s not for everybody. Loneliness is easy to solve, though. Coworking spaces, hostels,  are great places when you feel like you need some company and want to meet new friends.</p>

<h4 id="being-able-to-adapt-to-new-contexts-easily">Being Able To Adapt To New Contexts Easily</h4>

<p>On a rough average, I move from one place to another every four days. This is very tiring, because every time I switch cities, I have to repeat the same process: book transportation and accommodation, pack my stuff, figure out how to get around, check the weather and find out about the cost of living. Ideally, you won&rsquo;t be moving that often, but you should be able to grab your things quickly and move to a new place that better meets your expectations.</p>

<p>In some cases, you could plan to stay three or four months in the same spot, but the reality is that you will never know how you&rsquo;ll feel until you get there. So, my advice is: Go little by little, especially at the beginning.</p>

<h4 id="flexible-but-organized">Flexible But Organized</h4>

<p>I think I&rsquo;ve never been as organized as I&rsquo;ve been since I started traveling. Apart from the tools that I normally use to generate invoices, track payments and manage projects as a freelance designer, I also have several spreadsheets to organize my flights, accommodation and daily expenses.</p>

<p>The spreadsheet for expenses is divided into different categories and organized by day. I put in there all the money that goes out, so that I know exactly what&rsquo;s happening, and how close I am to reaching my daily budget. I know there are some apps for this, but so far I haven&rsquo;t felt comfortable with any of them. The key here is not to cheat (just write down everything) and to be consistent (do it every day) &mdash; this will give you good insight into how you are spending your money on the road. Then, it will be easier for you to make decisions based on the data gathered &mdash; for example, you could stop buying expensive cocktails so much.</p>

<h3 id="before-packing-find-a-remote-friendly-job">Before Packing: Find A Remote-Friendly Job</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve decided to give it a try, then, as a minimum, plan your start, and don&rsquo;t leave home without at least one or two months of contracted work. This will keep you busy for the first part of your trip, so you&rsquo;ll only have to worry about settling in a new place.</p>

<p>When I went to South America at the very beginning of my new life, I contacted several design organizations, schools and agencies that could help me organize design workshops and lectures in different countries. I did this because, a few months before leaving, I, along with a friend (¡hola  that gained some popularity among designers in Latin America, and I was willing to teach its contents and show how to put them into practice. Doing things like that provided me with at least some idea of dates and an approximate income, while leaving other things to improvisation.</p>


  <div id="sponsors-article" data-impression="true" class="c-promo-box c-promo-box--ad sponsors hidden" data-audience="non-subscriber" data-remove="true"></div>



<p>In my case, I&rsquo;ve always liked being a freelancer, so I give myself a bit more flexibility in managing my schedule. One of the last projects I worked on was for a team in Barcelona and in which the words &ldquo;remote&rdquo; and &ldquo;freelance&rdquo; were clear in our agreement from the very beginning. This is what allowed me to keep going from country to country, splitting my time between work and getting to know new places and people.</p>

<p>Just so you know how &ldquo;glamorous&rdquo; this way of working is, at the beginning of this project I tried to hide my background during video calls or said that I couldn&rsquo;t turn video on, because I was a bit embarrassed. By the end, though, my teammates didn&rsquo;t care about that, and so later on, usually the first question of a video call was to ask me for a tour of the place I was staying at, to everyone&rsquo;s amusement.</p>

<p>Of course, freelancing is not the only way. Working at a remote-friendly company could also be a good option for you. While you&rsquo;ll lose some of the freedom to move around, if you plan to stay longer in places, then this could be the way to go:  are some examples of companies that successfully work with designers and developers remotely, and there are many more.</p>

<p>A few websites list remote positions for design, so be sure to check them often:  &mdash; to name just some of them.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether you are freelancing or working for someone else, I have to say that face to face contact with members of your team is necessary from time to time to time, especially when planning meetings at the beginning of a project, when things are not all that clear. This will partly determine the location you choose, so best to pick a place that allows you to conveniently go where your team is based when needed.</p>

<h3 id="choosing-your-next-destination">Choosing Your Next Destination</h3>

<p>After finding work that allows you to be on the move, the next big thing is to decide where to base yourself. The good thing is that you can work from any place with a decent Internet connection and easy access to coffee (which is essential).</p>

<p>So far, I&rsquo;ve been in 60 countries, more or less. Many of them were in Europe, where it is easy to move from one place to another and where you can sometimes cross countries without even noticing. (True story: I once missed a whole country because I fell asleep on the train.)</p>

<p>When choosing where to go next, keep in mind the following.</p>

<h4 id="reliable-access-to-internet">Reliable Access To Internet</h4>

<p>You&rsquo;ll never know how good the Internet connection is until you get there, but at least . This is important. Even if you&rsquo;re tempted to spend a few days in the middle of a forest, if there is no access to Internet, it will probably be a no-go.</p>

<h4 id="time-zones">Time Zones</h4>

<p>Choose a place where you&rsquo;ll be in the same time zone with the rest of your team, or maybe a couple of hours ahead or behind. You&rsquo;ll thank me when you have to schedule your first online meeting and it&rsquo;s not 4:00 am.</p>

<h4 id="work-facilities">Work Facilities</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;ve said that I can work from almost anywhere, but I have to make sure that my next destination at least has some good coffee shops, libraries or coworking spaces. You could also work from your hostel, hotel or rented flat, but then you&rsquo;d have to make sure it&rsquo;s a proper environment to work in.</p>

<h4 id="design-ecosystem">Design Ecosystem</h4>

<p>It&rsquo;s always good to be surrounded by like-minded people, so many times before going somewhere, I&rsquo;ll check whether there&rsquo;s a designer, a design studio or a meetup where I could visit and get in touch with others. Luckily, some people are always willing to meet new pals, and they&rsquo;ll give you good insight into how the local design community works. You can exchange and share tools of the trade, and you can make new friends as well.</p>

			Sometimes I don't choose my destinations right… at least for getting some work done. Being in the middle of snowy places forced me to take unplanned vacations. Location: Mongolia.

</figure>


<p>In my case, sending some emails in advance enabled me to meet such talented people as  in Osaka. Just don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask if you can drop by for a short visit!</p>

<p>Besides that, other factors are at play when you&rsquo;re deciding where to go: affordability, transportation, safety, weather, etc. Fortunately, Nomad List rounds up the , which you can use as a reference when choosing where to head to next.</p>

<p>Of course, sooner or later, you&rsquo;ll make some mistake. I&rsquo;ve learned the hard way that <strong>planning where to work is indeed important</strong>. I once had to take a few unintended days off . At some point, the temperatures in the middle of Siberia were so low &mdash; the worst day was -50º Celsius &mdash; that my phones&rsquo; batteries suddenly drained &mdash; and being lost in the middle of a snowy small town is anything but fun. (The Russians there thought I was crazy for traveling during winter, and I now know they were right. But if you are like me and go there during wintertime anyway, always keep a paper copy of directions and important information, and bring warm boots and a pocket-sized bottle of vodka.)</p>

<h3 id="packing-and-gear">Packing And Gear</h3>

<p>If you already have a job and know where you are heading to, then you are ready to pack! Someone once said that before starting a trip, you should take half the things you plan to carry and double the money you have budgeted. While the last thing is not always an option, <strong>packing light</strong> is doable! You&rsquo;ll thank me when you find your accommodation is uphill.</p>

<p>I started traveling with a 50-liter backpack for my personal things, and a smaller one for work-related items that I carry separately. After some time, I switched the smaller one for a daypack that I can roll up and put into the big one when I don&rsquo;t need it. Everything (including the laptop) weighs 10 kilograms or so, but I keep assessing what else can I take off in order to have fewer things to carry. Similarly to when working on a design, try to .</p>

<p>For my work, I chose a MacBook Air because I knew I was going to travel a lot, and I wanted something lightweight and compact. Even though it&rsquo;s a bit old now, it&rsquo;s been enough for my requirements so far. I also carry two phones (iPhone and Android, with their corresponding chargers) because I do a lot of UX design for mobile and I often need to test on different devices.</p>

<p>I do have more gadgets and stuff, of course. I carry a remote to control my slides (for conferences and workshops), all kinds of adaptors, and noise-cancelling headphones (very useful for when you travel by train or plane.) But, in general, it is a good idea not to over-buy in advance, and pick up items only when you need them.</p>

<h3 id="where-to-work">Where To Work</h3>

<p>I have worked in all kinds of places: buses, trains, coffee shops, airport lounges, libraries, shared rooms in hostels, private rooms in hotels &mdash; sometimes anywhere I can set my laptop horizontally… or kind of. I&rsquo;ve even gotten used to not using a mouse at all, because there is not always a place to put it next to my laptop.</p>

<p>Chances are the room where you stay is also going to be where you will work, so choose carefully.  is now pretty much widespread, so renting your own room with a desk should be enough &mdash; but be sure to mark &ldquo;laptop friendly&rdquo; in the search filters.</p>

<p>I try to keep a low budget, so most of the time I stay in a hostel. After a bit of training, I&rsquo;ve learned to identify places that look better for work &mdash; like ones with spacious common areas &mdash; just by looking at the pictures. Of course, &ldquo;party hostels&rdquo; are not an option if you want to get work done, so if you see a lot of people having fun on the property&rsquo;s website, that&rsquo;s a red flag.</p>

<p>One of the main problems is that you never know how good the Internet connection will be. So, if you have difficulty with the Wi-Fi at your hostel, go to a coffee shop, coworking space or even a public library. (Interestingly, public libraries are where I&rsquo;m most productive, perhaps because of the silence and the fact that I cannot make calls or participate in online meetings.)</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> More than once, I&rsquo;ve visited a coworking space and offered to give a free design lecture to members in exchange of a few days&rsquo; worth of using a desk. It&rsquo;s also nice because afterwards people will know who you are and will approach you openly to share ideas! Feel free to try it yourself.</p>

<p>Finally, a couple of websites could be useful when you&rsquo;re looking for a place to work &mdash; namely, .</p>

<h3 id="things-to-keep-in-mind-when-living-on-the-road">Things To Keep In Mind When Living On The Road</h3>

<p>A few things are important for any traveling designer but are too complex to address completely in one article, so I&rsquo;ll just briefly mention a few of them, in the hope that it will still be useful.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that everybody&rsquo;s situation is different. There&rsquo;s no one-size-fits-all answer, so you might have to adapt the following to your case.</p>

<h4 id="taxes">Taxes</h4>

<p>What is convenient for you will depend on your case, and it&rsquo;s difficult to advise on what&rsquo;s best, so be aware of the legislation of your home country and of the country where you plan to work. I&rsquo;ve also been exploring the possibilities . I&rsquo;m already an Estonian e-resident, but I haven&rsquo;t done anything practical with this as of yet.</p>

<h4 id="managing-your-finances">Managing Your Finances</h4>

<p>Besides keeping spreadsheets for expenses, one thing that I discovered (perhaps too late) is that it is normally far more convenient to create an account in an app such as ), so that, when making withdrawals, you pay fewer fees and get better exchange rates. This is especially useful in places where credit or debit cards are not normal; this way, you can also avoid the excessive fees that traditional banks often charge.</p>

<p>Also, check the exchange rate of your home currency before arriving at your next destination. In some cases, I&rsquo;ve arrived in a new country and bought a very expensive coffee because I didn&rsquo;t do my homework beforehand. One app I use to avoid situations like this is , an elegant and simple currency converter.</p>

<h4 id="visas">Visas</h4>

<p>The situation will depend on where you&rsquo;re from and where you&rsquo;re going, so .</p>

<p>Something useful I learned when applying for a visa that requires a tentative itinerary is to book hostels and planes that you can later on cancel for free, and print out and bring those booking confirmations.</p>

<h4 id="health-and-insurance">Health And Insurance</h4>

<p>Plenty of companies offer health insurance for travel, so I cannot recommend any one of them. The only thing I can advise is not to leave home without it. An accident in a foreign country, besides being annoying, could also be very expensive. So, prepare in advance.</p>

</figure>


<h4 id="getting-connected">Getting Connected</h4>

<p>What I normally do is buy a prepaid SIM card in each country I stay, with a data plan that will be enough for my stay there. I do a bit of research beforehand to see which carrier has the most widespread coverage, and I check if there&rsquo;s any information in English on their website to make recharges when necessary.</p>

<p>A SIM card is more necessary in some countries than in others. For example, in Russia, most open Wi-Fi networks require you to fill in a phone number, to which a validation code will be sent, before you are able to use the network. Japan, on the other hand, is full of convenience stores with free internet (such as 7-Eleven), so a SIM card is not so necessary. Meanwhile,  and getting a new SIM card in every country is not so necessary anymore.</p>

<p>In any case, before buying a SIM card, make sure it will work across the country, especially if the country is large with many different regions.
Another important thing to check beforehand: Will your current phone number work in the new country? Luckily, .</p>

<h4 id="preparing-to-be-offline">Preparing To Be Offline</h4>

<p>Moving from one place to another involves a lot of time spent on the road, and in some cases you won&rsquo;t have the chance to find Wi-Fi or good data network coverage. At these times,  are my best friends, because both allow me to download music and TV shows, respectively, so I can use them without an Internet connection. This was especially useful when I had to take several connecting trains to cross Siberia, spending in some cases around 30 hours straight in a railroad car before my next stop.</p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>Before I board my next train, let me tell you that becoming a nomadic freelance designer is by far one of my best decisions of my life so far. I have the flexibility that any freelancer has, but I also meet new people and see new places all the time. And it&rsquo;s not as expensive as you might think. If you control your budget, traveling could be cheaper than living in a big city. So, I can afford to work four to five hours every day, and I use the rest of the time to get to know the place I&rsquo;m visiting, to work on personal projects and to .</p>

<p>Traveling also makes it a bit hard to separate pleasure from work, because everything seems more enjoyable when you&rsquo;re moving around. I&rsquo;ve had to remind myself sometimes that I&rsquo;m not on a vacation and to focus on getting things done. After a while, though, I&rsquo;ve found a good balance. Now, I allow myself some moments to just move around, travel and enjoy the ride, doing nothing. It&rsquo;s not all about work, after all!</p>

<p>Living like this is sometimes challenging and tiring, but I find it much richer than being in an office Monday to Friday, 9:00 to 5:00. And with all of the current technology, it&rsquo;s easy for any designer to embrace this lifestyle. The most difficult part is finding a job to sustain your travel, but once you&rsquo;ve found it, the next part is just to let it flow.</p>

<p>The nomadic lifestyle is not right for everyone, but the only way to know for sure is to try. Neale Donald Walsch once said that , and I completely agree. If you can afford to take the risk, go for it and enjoy a part of life that might not last long but will give you a life-changing experience, teach you new things and change the way you see the world forever.</p>

<p>If, for some reason, it doesn&rsquo;t work, you can always go back to your previous life, right? Whether you are ready to give it a try or still have some questions about it, . I&rsquo;ll do my best to help you out. See you on the road!</p>
