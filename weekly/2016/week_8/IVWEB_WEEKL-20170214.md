<p><strong>Next-generation 3D Graphics on the Web</strong><br />
https://webkit.org/blog/7380/next-generation-3d-graphics-on-the-web/<br />
We’re sharing an API proposal, and a prototype of that API for the WebKit Open Source project. We hope this is a useful starting point, and look forward to seeing the API evolve as discussions proceed in the Community Group. Let’s cover the details of how we got to this point, and how this new group relates to existing Web graphics APIs such as WebGL. metal 的 webgl 版本，微软和谷歌会接受么？</p>

<p><strong>Graph Engine - SERVING BIG GRAPHS IN REAL-TIME</strong><br />
https://github.com/Microsoft/GraphEngine<br />
https://www.graphengine.io/<br />
Microsoft Graph Engine is a distributed in-memory data processing engine, underpinned by a strongly-typed in-memory key-value store and a general distributed computation engine. Graph Engine (GE) is a distributed in-memory data processing engine, underpinned by a strongly-typed RAM store and a general distributed computation engine. The distributed RAM store provides a globally addressable high-performance key-value store over a cluster of machines. Through the RAM store, GE enables the fast random data access power over a large distributed data set.</p>

<p><strong>JavaScript Start-up Performance</strong><br />
https://medium.com/@addyosmani/javascript-start-up-performance-69200f43b201#.lw9hoijm1<br />

As web developers, we know how easy it is to end up with web page bloat. But loading a webpage is much more than shipping bytes down the wire. Once the browser has downloaded our page’s scripts it then has to parse, interpret &amp; run them. In this post, we’ll dive into this phase for JavaScript, why it might be slowing down your app’s start-up &amp; how you can fix it.</p>

<p><strong>React Native at Instagram</strong><br />
https://engineering.instagram.com/react-native-at-instagram-dd828a9a90c7#.88w3t9ina<br />
Developer velocity is a defining value of Instagram’s mobile engineering. In early 2016, we started exploring using React Native to allow product teams to ship features faster through code sharing and higher iteration speeds, using tools like Live Reload and Hot Reloading that eliminate compile-install cycles.</p>

<p><strong>Beringei: A high-performance time series storage engine</strong><br />
https://code.facebook.com/posts/952820474848503/beringei-a-high-performance-time-series-storage-engine/<br />
Operating large-scale, globally distributed services requires accurate monitoring of the health and performance of our systems to identify and diagnose problems as they arise. Facebook uses a time series database (TSDB) to track and store system measurements such as product stats (e.g., how many messages are being sent per minute), service stats (e.g., the rate of queries hitting the cache tier vs the MySQL tier), and system stats (e.g., CPU, memory, and network usage), so that we can see the real-time load on our infrastructure and make decisions about how to allocate resources. 相关文：</p>

<p><strong>Our long term plan to make GitLab as fast as possible with Vue and Webpack</strong><br />
https://about.gitlab.com/2017/02/06/vue-big-plan/<br />
The Frontend at GitLab is getting better and better every day. Today we did two big things, and I’d like to share them with you and our big plans for the future.</p>

<p><strong>What’s in an AMP URL?</strong><br />
https://developers.googleblog.com/2017/02/whats-in-amp-url.html<br />
We’re adding a feature to the AMP integration in Google Search that allows users to access, copy, and share the canonical URL of an AMP document. But before diving deeper into the news, let’s take a step back to elaborate more on URLs in the AMP world and how they relate to the speed benefits of AMP.</p>

<p><strong>WebPack is not the only way</strong><br />

<p><strong>HTML APIs: What They Are And How To Design A Good One</strong><br />
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/02/designing-html-apis/<br />
HTML APIs improve collaboration between designers and developers, lift some work from the shoulders of the latter, and enable designers to create much higher-fidelity mockups. Including an HTML API in your library does not just make the community more inclusive, it also ultimately comes back to benefit you, the programmer.</p>

<p><strong>Concurrency and Parallelism: Understanding I/O</strong><br />
https://blog.risingstack.com/concurrency-and-parallelism-understanding-i-o/<br />
With this article, we are launching a series of posts targeting developers who want to learn or refresh their knowledge about writing concurrent applications in general. The series will focus on well-known and widely adopted concurrency patterns in different programming languages, platforms, and runtimes.</p>

<p><strong>Why Elm? (And How To Get Started With It)</strong><br />
https://css-tricks.com/elm-get-started/<br />
Elm is a relatively new programming language to build web applications created by Evan Czaplicki in 2012 as part of his thesis about Concurrent FRP for Functional GUIs. Because it’s targeted to the web—and browsers only understand a limited set of languages—the code that you write in Elm is compiled to HTML, CSS, and JS.</p>

<p><strong>A first look at WebAssembly performance</strong><br />
http://www.stefankrause.net/wp/?p=405<br />
WebAssembly gives us the promise to run high performance code in the browser in a standardized way. Now that there are a few WebAssembly previews available I decided it’s time to take a look at their performance. One source for benchmarks is the well known Computer Language Benchmarks Game and I decided to pick nbody (it’s almost four years ago since I did so last time…). 另：.</p>

<p><strong>Introducing Docker Secrets Management</strong><br />
https://blog.docker.com/2017/02/docker-secrets-management/<br />
We fundamentally believe that apps are safer if there is a standardized interface for accessing secrets. Any good solution will also have to follow security best practices, such as encrypting secrets while in transit; encrypting secrets at rest; preventing secrets from unintentionally leaking when consumed by the final application; and strictly adhere to the principle of least-privilege, where an application only has access to the secrets that it needs—no more, no less.</p>

<p><strong>Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;h&gt;</code> element</strong><br />
https://github.com/w3c/html/issues/774<br />
We need a heading element without implicit order. We need a heading element that can be updated without being replaced. Please consider <h>. The <h> element is desired for situations where the “ranking” context changes for a heading, either before or after the source is sent to the browser. The current process of figuring out the appropriate “rank” of a heading is as unnecessary as requiring &lt;li&gt; to be <l1-n>.</l1-n></h></h></p>

I’ll start with a quick introduction to its basics, and then showcase the functionality of the library with the help of two short, yet spectacular samples: the first one is all about art, whereas the second one illustrates how to code a simple time-killer art game in less than 50 lines.</p>

<p><strong>Mnemonist</strong><br />
https://yomguithereal.github.io/mnemonist/<br />
Mnemonist is a collection of data structures implemented in JavaScript. It gathers classic data structures (think heap, trie etc.) as well as more exotic ones such as Burkhard-Keller trees etc. It strives at being: As performant as possible for a high-level language; Completely modular (don’t need to import the whole library just to use a simple heap); Simple &amp; straightforward to use and consistent with JavaScript standard objects’ API.</p>

<p><strong>wuzz - Interactive cli tool for HTTP inspection</strong><br />

Wuzz command line arguments are similar to cURL’s arguments, so it can be used to inspect/modify requests copied from the browser’s network inspector with the “copy as cURL” feature.</p>

<p><strong>.dom</strong><br />
https://github.com/wavesoft/dot-dom<br />
.dom borrows some concepts from React.js (such as the re-usable Components and the Virtual DOM) and tries to replicate them with the smallest possible footprint, exploiting the ES6 javascript features. Why? Because with such library you can create powerful GUIs in tight space environments, such as IoT devices, where saving even an extra byte actually matters!</p>

<img src="http://www.infoq.com/resource/presentations/panoramic-business-monitoring-platform/zh/mediumimage/maxiaopeng270.jpg"/><p>本次演讲向大家介绍一种基于数据统计分析的业务监控检测方法，通过收集监测数据的样本，并使用智能检测算法模型，让程序自动对监控项指标的基准值、阈值做预测，在检测判断异常报警时使用规则组合和均值漂移算法，能精确地判断需要报警的异常点和变点。因为传统的同环比对比比较单调，在工作日和节假日对差异下存在大量的误报、漏报，在监测指标波动时不能有效地过滤掉不值得关注的疑似异常，大量的误报会淹没真正的异常报警。我们从预测样本的选取、监控项报警检测灵敏度区分、异常持续状态次数、均值漂移过程等方面做了智能检测程序，可以避免人工维护的惰性和不可持续性带来的隐患。在故障辅助定位方面，我们通过建立全链路 tracing、上下游数据关联依赖、数据粒度逐层细分、诊断树模型等方式，缩小排查定位问题的范围，直接通过数据分析提供可参考的定位信息，在实际应用中可以降低故障带来的损失。</p> <i>By 马小鹏</i>

</table><p>Many criticize gestural controls as being unintuitive and unnecessary. Despite this, widespread adoption is underway already, and the UI design world is burning the candle at both ends to develop solutions that are instinctively tactile. The challenges here are those of novelty.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Even though gestural controls have been around since the early 1980s and have enjoyed a level of ubiquity since the early 2000s, designers are still in the beta-testing phase of making gestural controls intuitive for everyday use.</p><p>The post .</p>
